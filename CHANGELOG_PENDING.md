### SDK Features
* `service/iotdataplane`: As part of this release, we are introducing a new feature called named shadow, which extends the capability of AWS IoT Device Shadow to support multiple shadows for a single IoT device. With this release, customers can store different device state data into different shadows, and as a result access only the required state data when needed and reduce individual shadow size.
