  "service": "<p>This is the <i>Resource Access Manager API Reference</i>. This documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources to other Amazon Web Services accounts. If you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you can share your resources with your entire organization or to organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you can also share resources with individual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users. </p> <p>To learn more about RAM, see the following resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ram\">Resource Access Manager product page</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/\">Resource Access Manager User Guide</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

After you accept the invitation, the resources included in the resource share are available to interact with in the relevant Amazon Web Services Management Consoles and tools.</p>",
    "AssociateResourceShare": "<p>Adds the specified list of principals and list of resources to a resource share. Principals that already have access to this resource share immediately receive access to the added resources. Newly added principals immediately receive access to the resources shared in this resource share. </p>",
    "AssociateResourceSharePermission": "<p>Adds or replaces the RAM permission for a resource type included in a resource share. You can have exactly one permission associated with each resource type in the resource share. You can add a new RAM permission only if there are currently no resources of that resource type currently in the resource share.</p>",
    "CreatePermission": "<p>Creates a customer managed permission for a specified resource type that you can attach to resource shares. It is created in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you call the operation.</p>",
    "CreatePermissionVersion": "<p>Creates a new version of the specified customer managed permission. The new version is automatically set as the default version of the customer managed permission. New resource shares automatically use the default permission. Existing resource shares continue to use their original permission versions, but you can use <a>ReplacePermissionAssociations</a> to update them.</p> <p>If the specified customer managed permission already has the maximum of 5 versions, then you must delete one of the existing versions before you can create a new one.</p>",

You can delete a customer managed permission only if it isn't attached to any resource share. The operation deletes all versions associated with the customer managed permission.</p>",

The version you specify must not be attached to any resource share and must not be the default version for the permission.</p> <p>If a customer managed permission has the maximum of 5 versions, then you must delete at least one version before you can create another.</p>",
    "DeleteResourceShare": "<p>Deletes the specified resource share.</p> <important> <p>This doesn't delete any of the resources that were associated with the resource share; it only stops the sharing of those resources through this resource share.</p> </important>",
    "DisassociateResourceShare": "<p>Removes the specified principals or resources from participating in the specified resource share.</p>",
    "DisassociateResourceSharePermission": "<p>Removes a managed permission from a resource share. Permission changes take effect immediately. You can remove a managed permission from a resource share only if there are currently no resources of the relevant resource type currently attached to the resource share.</p>",
    "EnableSharingWithAwsOrganization": "<p>Enables resource sharing within your organization in Organizations. This operation creates a service-linked role called <code>AWSServiceRoleForResourceAccessManager</code> that has the IAM managed policy named AWSResourceAccessManagerServiceRolePolicy attached. This role permits RAM to retrieve information about the organization and its structure. This lets you share resources with all of the accounts in the calling account's organization by specifying the organization ID, or all of the accounts in an organizational unit (OU) by specifying the OU ID. Until you enable sharing within the organization, you can specify only individual Amazon Web Services accounts, or for supported resource types, IAM roles and users.</p> <p>You must call this operation from an IAM role or user in the organization's management account.</p> <p/>",

    "ReplacePermissionAssociations": "<p>Updates all resource shares that use a managed permission to a different managed permission. This operation always applies the default version of the target managed permission. You can optionally specify that the update applies to only resource shares that currently use a specified version. This enables you to update to the latest version, without changing the which managed permission is used.</p> <p>You can use this operation to update all of your resource shares to use the current default version of the permission by specifying the same value for the <code>fromPermissionArn</code> and <code>toPermissionArn</code> parameters.</p> <p>You can use the optional <code>fromPermissionVersion</code> parameter to update only those resources that use a specified version of the managed permission to the new managed permission.</p> <important> <p>To successfully perform this operation, you must have permission to update the resource-based policy on all affected resource types.</p> </important>",
