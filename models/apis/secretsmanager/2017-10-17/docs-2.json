By using information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail\">Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.

If you include <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to it.</p> <p>For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the <code>SecretString</code> matches the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_secret_json_structure.html\">JSON structure of a database secret</a>.</p> <p>If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>.

To change the secret value, you can also use <a>PutSecretValue</a>.</p> <p>To change the rotation configuration of a secret, use <a>RotateSecret</a> instead.</p> <p>To change a secret so that it is managed by another service, you need to recreate the secret in that service. See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/service-linked-secrets.html\">Secrets Manager secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services</a>.</p> <p>We recommend you avoid calling <code>UpdateSecret</code> at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When you call <code>UpdateSecret</code> to update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you update the secret value more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions.</p> <p>If you include <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> to create a new secret version, Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to the new version. Then it attaches the label <code>AWSPREVIOUS</code> to the version that <code>AWSCURRENT</code> was removed from.</p> <p>If you call this operation with a <code>ClientRequestToken</code> that matches an existing version's <code>VersionId</code>, the operation results in an error. You can't modify an existing version, you can only create a new version. To remove a version, remove all staging labels from it.
