  "service": "<fullname>AWS App Runner</fullname> <p>AWS App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code to a running service in the AWS cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure AWS resources.</p> <p>App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security.</p> <p>For more information about App Runner, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/\">AWS App Runner Developer Guide</a>. For release information, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/\">AWS App Runner Release Notes</a>.</p> <p> To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html\">AWS App Runner endpoints and quotas</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p>",

For each mapped domain name, add a mapping to the target App Runner subdomain and one or more certificate validation records. App Runner then performs DNS validation to verify that you own or control the domain name that you associated. App Runner tracks domain validity in a certificate stored in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide\">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>.</p>",

When you create a service, you can set it to use the latest active revision of an auto scaling configuration or a specific revision.</p> <p>Configure a higher <code>MinSize</code> to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the AWS Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.</p> <p>Configure a lower <code>MaxSize</code> to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.</p>",
