  "service": "<fullname>AWS Certificate Manager</fullname> <p>Welcome to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Command Reference. This guide provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each ACM command. You can use AWS Certificate Manager to request ACM Certificates for your AWS-based websites and applications. For general information about using ACM and for more information about using the console, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html\">AWS Certificate Manager User Guide</a>. For more information about using the ACM API, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html\">AWS Certificate Manager API Reference</a>.</p>",
  "operations": {
    "AddTagsToCertificate": "<p>Adds one or more tags to an ACM Certificate. Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a <code>key</code> and an optional <code>value</code>. You specify the certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify the tag by using a key-value pair.</p> <p>You can apply a tag to just one certificate if you want to identify a specific characteristic of that certificate, or you can apply the same tag to multiple certificates if you want to filter for a common relationship among those certificates. Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add the same tag to an ACM Certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to indicate that they are both used by the same website. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/tags.html\">Tagging ACM Certificates</a>.</p> <p>To remove one or more tags, use the <a>RemoveTagsFromCertificate</a> action. To view all of the tags that have been applied to the certificate, use the <a>ListTagsForCertificate</a> action.</p>",
    "DeleteCertificate": "<p>Deletes an ACM Certificate and its associated private key. If this action succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the list of ACM Certificates that can be displayed by calling the <a>ListCertificates</a> action or be retrieved by calling the <a>GetCertificate</a> action. The certificate will not be available for use by other AWS services.</p> <note> <p>You cannot delete an ACM Certificate that is being used by another AWS service. To delete a certificate that is in use, the certificate association must first be removed.</p> </note>",
    "DescribeCertificate": "<p>Returns a list of the fields contained in the specified ACM Certificate. For example, this action returns the certificate status, a flag that indicates whether the certificate is associated with any other AWS service, and the date at which the certificate request was created. You specify the ACM Certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).</p>",
    "GetCertificate": "<p>Retrieves an ACM Certificate and certificate chain for the certificate specified by an ARN. The chain is an ordered list of certificates that contains the root certificate, intermediate certificates of subordinate CAs, and the ACM Certificate. The certificate and certificate chain are base64 encoded. If you want to decode the certificate chain to see the individual certificate fields, you can use OpenSSL.</p> <note> <p>Currently, ACM Certificates can be used only with Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon CloudFront.</p> </note>",
    "ListCertificates": "<p>Retrieves a list of ACM Certificates and the domain name for each. You can optionally filter the list to return only the certificates that match the specified status.</p>",
    "ListTagsForCertificate": "<p>Lists the tags that have been applied to the ACM Certificate. Use the certificate ARN to specify the certificate. To add a tag to an ACM Certificate, use the <a>AddTagsToCertificate</a> action. To delete a tag, use the <a>RemoveTagsFromCertificate</a> action.</p>",
    "RemoveTagsFromCertificate": "<p>Remove one or more tags from an ACM Certificate. A tag consists of a key-value pair. If you do not specify the value portion of the tag when calling this function, the tag will be removed regardless of value. If you specify a value, the tag is removed only if it is associated with the specified value.</p> <p>To add tags to a certificate, use the <a>AddTagsToCertificate</a> action. To view all of the tags that have been applied to a specific ACM Certificate, use the <a>ListTagsForCertificate</a> action.</p>",
    "RequestCertificate": "<p>Requests an ACM Certificate for use with other AWS services. To request an ACM Certificate, you must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your site. You can also specify additional FQDNs if users can reach your site by using other names. For each domain name you specify, email is sent to the domain owner to request approval to issue the certificate. After receiving approval from the domain owner, the ACM Certificate is issued. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/overview.html\">AWS Certificate Manager User Guide </a>.</p>",
    "ResendValidationEmail": "<p>Resends the email that requests domain ownership validation. The domain owner or an authorized representative must approve the ACM Certificate before it can be issued. The certificate can be approved by clicking a link in the mail to navigate to the Amazon certificate approval website and then clicking <b>I Approve</b>. However, the validation email can be blocked by spam filters. Therefore, if you do not receive the original mail, you can request that the mail be resent within 72 hours of requesting the ACM Certificate. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since your original request or since your last attempt to resend validation mail, you must request a new certificate.</p>"
