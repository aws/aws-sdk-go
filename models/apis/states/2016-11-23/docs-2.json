  "service": "<fullname>Step Functions</fullname> <p>Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.</p> <p>You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components, each of which performs a discrete function, or <i>task</i>, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any issues.</p> <p>Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services, your own servers, or any system that has access to Amazon Web Services. You can access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the <i> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html\">Step Functions Developer Guide</a> </i>.</p>",
  "operations": {
    "CreateActivity": "<p>Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the <code>GetActivityTask</code> API action and respond using <code>SendTask*</code> API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.</p> <note> <p>This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.</p> </note> <note> <p> <code>CreateActivity</code> is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. <code>CreateActivity</code>'s idempotency check is based on the activity <code>name</code>. If a following request has different <code>tags</code> values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, <code>tags</code> will not be updated, even if they are different.</p> </note>",
    "CreateStateMachine": "<p>Creates a state machine. A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (<code>Task</code> states), determine to which states to transition next (<code>Choice</code> states), stop an execution with an error (<code>Fail</code> states), and so on. State machines are specified using a JSON-based, structured language.

Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. <code>CreateStateMachine</code>'s idempotency check is based on the state machine <code>name</code>, <code>definition</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>LoggingConfiguration</code> and <code>TracingConfiguration</code>. If a following request has a different <code>roleArn</code> or <code>tags</code>, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous.

    "GetActivityTask": "<p>Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN) which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of this type is needed.)
