You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination Region per account.</p> <p>You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-region disaster recovery. You periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your Amazon Web Services partition.</p> <p> You can also use backup copies to clone your file data set to another Region or within the same Region.</p> <p>You can use the <code>SourceRegion</code> parameter to specify the Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the <code>us-west-1</code> Region and want to copy a backup from the <code>us-east-2</code> Region, you specify <code>us-east-2</code> in the <code>SourceRegion</code> parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).</p> <p>For more information on creating backup copies, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html#copy-backups\"> Copying backups</a> in the <i>Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide</i> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html#copy-backups\">Copying backups</a> in the <i>Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide</i>.</p>",
