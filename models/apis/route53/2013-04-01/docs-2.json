    "ChangeResourceRecordSets": "<p>Create, change, update, or delete authoritative DNS information on all Amazon Route 53 servers. Send a <code>POST</code> request to: </p> <p> <code>/2013-04-01/hostedzone/<i>Amazon Route 53 hosted Zone ID</i>/rrset</code> resource. </p> <p>The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of the changes in a change batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. </p> <p>For example, a change batch request that deletes the <code>CNAME</code> record for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails, then both changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist.</p> <important> <p>Due to the nature of transactional changes, you cannot delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.</p> </important> <note> <p>To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected.

If a resource set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. Amazon Route 53 can update an existing resource record set only when all of the following values match: <code>Name</code>, <code>Type</code>, and <code>Set Identifier</code> (for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets).</p> </li> </ul> <p>In response to a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, the DNS data is changed on all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers. Initially, the status of a change is <code>PENDING</code>, meaning the change has not yet propagated to all the authoritative Amazon Route 53 DNS servers. When the change is propagated to all hosts, the change returns a status of <code>INSYNC</code>.</p> <p>After sending a change request, confirm your change has propagated to all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers. Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances, propagation can take up to 30 minutes.

For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 <code>StatusCheckFailed</code> metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm.
