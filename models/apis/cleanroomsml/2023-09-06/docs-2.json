The first party brings the training data to Clean Rooms so that they can create and configure an audience model (lookalike model) and associate it with a collaboration. The second party then brings their seed data to Clean Rooms and generates an audience (lookalike segment) that resembles the training data.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML concepts, procedures, and best practices, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/machine-learning.html\">Clean Rooms User Guide</a>.</p> <p>To learn more about SQL commands, functions, and conditions supported in Clean Rooms, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/sql-reference/sql-reference.html\">Clean Rooms SQL Reference</a>.</p>",
