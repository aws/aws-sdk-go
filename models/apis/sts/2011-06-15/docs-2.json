You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role.

This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>",

Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html\">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Session duration</b> </p> <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any AWS service except the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API. </p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.</p>",
    "GetSessionToken": "<p>Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS API operations like Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code>. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a comparison of <code>GetSessionToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>The <code>GetSessionToken</code> operation must be called by using the long-term AWS security credentials of the AWS account root user or an IAM user. Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration that you specify. This duration can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Credentials based on account credentials can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour. </p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>GetSessionToken</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication information is included in the request.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS API <i>except</i> <code>AssumeRole</code> or <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>We recommend that you do not call <code>GetSessionToken</code> with AWS account root user credentials. Instead, follow our <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users\">best practices</a> by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS. </p> </note> <p>The credentials that are returned by <code>GetSessionToken</code> are based on permissions associated with the user whose credentials were used to call the operation. If <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using AWS account root user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user permissions. Similarly, if <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using the credentials of an IAM user, the temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user. </p> <p>For more information about using <code>GetSessionToken</code> to create temporary credentials, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getsessiontoken\">Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted Environments</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p>"
