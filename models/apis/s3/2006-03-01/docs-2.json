For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the <code>ETag</code> value, returned after that part was uploaded.</p> <p>Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded.</p> <p>Note that if <code>CompleteMultipartUpload</code> fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests.

You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html\">Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API</a>.</p> </note> <p>All copy requests must be authenticated.

For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html\">REST Authentication</a>. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.</p> <p>A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code> response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.</p> <p>If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.</p> <note> <p>If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded.

However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Using ACLs</a>. </p> <p>To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the <code>x-amz-metadata-directive</code> header. When you grant permissions, you can use the <code>s3:x-amz-metadata-directive</code> condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html\">Specifying Conditions in a Policy</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Developer Guide</i>.

With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html\">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object.

By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html\">Managing ACLs Using the REST API</a>. </p> <p> <b>Storage Class Options</b> </p> <p>You can use the <code>CopyObject</code> action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the <code>StorageClass</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html\">Storage Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Versioning</b> </p> <p>By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p> <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p> <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p> <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation.

The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, <code>Expires</code>, <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Disposition</code>, and <code>Content-Encoding</code>.

Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.</p> <note> <p> The <code>Content-MD5</code> header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html\">Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> </note> <p> <b>Server-side Encryption</b> </p> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html\">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>If you request server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html\">Amazon S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</b> </p> <p>You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html\">Managing ACLs Using the REST API</a>. </p> <p> <b>Storage Class Options</b> </p> <p>By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html\">Storage Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Versioning</b> </p> <p>If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.</p> <p>For more information about versioning, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html\">Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets</a>.

For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.</p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

    "UploadPart": "<p>Uploads a part in a multipart upload.</p> <note> <p>In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a> operation. </p> </note> <p>You must initiate a multipart upload (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html\">CreateMultipartUpload</a>) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.</p> <p>Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.</p> <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the <code>Content-MD5</code> header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. </p> <p>If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3 uses the <code>x-amz-content-sha256</code> header as a checksum instead of <code>Content-MD5</code>. For more information see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html\">Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version 4)</a>. </p> <p> <b>Note:</b> After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.</p> <p>For more information on multipart uploads, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html\">Multipart Upload Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide </i>.</p> <p>For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html\">Multipart Upload and Permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html\">CreateMultipartUpload</a>.
