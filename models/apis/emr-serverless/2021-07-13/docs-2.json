The <code>emr-serverless</code> prefix is used in the following scenarios: </p> <ul> <li> <p>It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, <code>aws emr-serverless start-job-run</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, <code>\"Action\": [\"emr-serverless:StartJobRun\"]</code>.
