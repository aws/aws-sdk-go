Businesses use EDI documents to exchange transactional data with trading partners, such as suppliers and end customers, using standardized formats such as X12.</p> <note> <p>Rather than actually running a command, you can use the <code>--generate-cli-skeleton</code> parameter with any API call to generate and display a parameter template.
