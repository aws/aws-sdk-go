    "CreateAccountCustomization": "<p>Creates Amazon QuickSight customizations for the current Amazon Web Services Region. Currently, you can add a custom default theme by using the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> or <code>UpdateAccountCustomization</code> API operation. To further customize Amazon QuickSight by removing Amazon QuickSight sample assets and videos for all new users, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/customizing-quicksight.html\">Customizing Amazon QuickSight</a> in the <i>Amazon QuickSight User Guide.</i> </p> <p>You can create customizations for your Amazon Web Services account or, if you specify a namespace, for a QuickSight namespace instead. Customizations that apply to a namespace always override customizations that apply to an Amazon Web Services account. To find out which customizations apply, use the <code>DescribeAccountCustomization</code> API operation.</p> <p>Before you use the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> API operation to add a theme as the namespace default, make sure that you first share the theme with the namespace. If you don't share it with the namespace, the theme isn't visible to your users even if you make it the default theme. To check if the theme is shared, view the current permissions by using the <code> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeThemePermissions.html\">DescribeThemePermissions</a> </code> API operation. To share the theme, grant permissions by using the <code> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateThemePermissions.html\">UpdateThemePermissions</a> </code> API operation. </p>",
    "CreateAccountSubscription": "<p>Creates an Amazon QuickSight account, or subscribes to Amazon QuickSight Q.</p> <p>The Amazon Web Services Region for the account is derived from what is configured in the CLI or SDK.

    "CreateIngestion": "<p>Creates and starts a new SPICE ingestion for a dataset. You can manually refresh datasets in an Enterprise edition account 32 times in a 24-hour period. You can manually refresh datasets in a Standard edition account 8 times in a 24-hour period. Each 24-hour period is measured starting 24 hours before the current date and time.</p> <p>Any ingestions operating on tagged datasets inherit the same tags automatically for use in access control. For an example, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/iam-ec2-resource-tags/\">How do I create an IAM policy to control access to Amazon EC2 resources using tags?</a> in the Amazon Web Services Knowledge Center.

    "CreateNamespace": "<p>(Enterprise edition only) Creates a new namespace for you to use with Amazon QuickSight.</p> <p>A namespace allows you to isolate the Amazon QuickSight users and groups that are registered for that namespace. Users that access the namespace can share assets only with other users or groups in the same namespace. They can't see users and groups in other namespaces. You can create a namespace after your Amazon Web Services account is subscribed to Amazon QuickSight. The namespace must be unique within the Amazon Web Services account. By default, there is a limit of 100 namespaces per Amazon Web Services account. To increase your limit, create a ticket with Amazon Web Services Support. </p>",
    "CreateTemplate": "<p>Creates a template from an existing Amazon QuickSight analysis or template. You can use the resulting template to create a dashboard.</p> <p>A <i>template</i> is an entity in Amazon QuickSight that encapsulates the metadata required to create an analysis and that you can use to create s dashboard. A template adds a layer of abstraction by using placeholders to replace the dataset associated with the analysis.

This operation will result in an error message if you have configured your account termination protection settings to <code>True</code>. To change this setting and delete your account, call the <code>UpdateAccountSettings</code> API and set the value of the <code>TerminationProtectionEnabled</code> parameter to <code>False</code>, then make another call to the <code>DeleteAccountSubscription</code> API.</p>",
    "DeleteAnalysis": "<p>Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.</p> <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the <code>RestoreAnalysis</code> API operation to remove the <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it.</p> <p>An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the Amazon QuickSight console.

    "DescribeAccountCustomization": "<p>Describes the customizations associated with the provided Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Amazon QuickSight namespace in an Amazon Web Services Region. The Amazon QuickSight console evaluates which customizations to apply by running this API operation with the <code>Resolved</code> flag included. </p> <p>To determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved. </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Amazon Web Services account</code> - The Amazon Web Services account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services Services. When you subscribe to Amazon QuickSight, you choose one Amazon Web Services Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use Amazon QuickSight in any supported Amazon Web Services Region. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Amazon Web Services Region</code> - In each Amazon Web Services Region where you sign in to Amazon QuickSight at least once, Amazon QuickSight acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to Amazon QuickSight in any Amazon Web Services Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace. </p> <p>To run the command in a different Amazon Web Services Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the CLI, you can use one of the following options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html\">command line options</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html\">named profiles</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Run <code>aws configure</code> to change your default Amazon Web Services Region.

To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Applied customizations</code> - Within an Amazon Web Services Region, a set of Amazon QuickSight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Services account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account. All settings are isolated to a single Amazon Web Services Region. To apply them in other Amazon Web Services Regions, run the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> command in each Amazon Web Services Region where you want to apply the same customizations. </p> </li> </ul>",
