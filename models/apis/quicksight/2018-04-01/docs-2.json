    "CreateAccountCustomization": "<p>Creates Amazon QuickSight customizations for the current Amazon Web Services Region. Currently, you can add a custom default theme by using the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> or <code>UpdateAccountCustomization</code> API operation. To further customize Amazon QuickSight by removing Amazon QuickSight sample assets and videos for all new users, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/customizing-quicksight.html\">Customizing Amazon QuickSight</a> in the <i>Amazon QuickSight User Guide.</i> </p> <p>You can create customizations for your Amazon Web Services account or, if you specify a namespace, for a QuickSight namespace instead. Customizations that apply to a namespace always override customizations that apply to an Amazon Web Services account. To find out which customizations apply, use the <code>DescribeAccountCustomization</code> API operation.</p> <p>Before you use the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> API operation to add a theme as the namespace default, make sure that you first share the theme with the namespace. If you don't share it with the namespace, the theme isn't visible to your users even if you make it the default theme. To check if the theme is shared, view the current permissions by using the <code> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeThemePermissions.html\">DescribeThemePermissions</a> </code> API operation. To share the theme, grant permissions by using the <code> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateThemePermissions.html\">UpdateThemePermissions</a> </code> API operation. </p>",

You can manually refresh datasets in a Standard edition account 8 times in a 24-hour period. Each 24-hour period is measured starting 24 hours before the current date and time.</p> <p>Any ingestions operating on tagged datasets inherit the same tags automatically for use in access control. For an example, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/iam-ec2-resource-tags/\">How do I create an IAM policy to control access to Amazon EC2 resources using tags?</a> in the Amazon Web Services Knowledge Center. Tags are visible on the tagged dataset, but not on the ingestion resource.</p>",
    "CreateNamespace": "<p>(Enterprise edition only) Creates a new namespace for you to use with Amazon QuickSight.</p> <p>A namespace allows you to isolate the Amazon QuickSight users and groups that are registered for that namespace.

    "DeleteAnalysis": "<p>Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.</p> <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the <code>RestoreAnalysis</code> API operation to remove the <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it.</p> <p>An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the Amazon QuickSight console.

For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html\">Configuring the CLI</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <code>Namespace</code> - A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Applied customizations</code> - Within an Amazon Web Services Region, a set of Amazon QuickSight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Services account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account. All settings are isolated to a single Amazon Web Services Region. To apply them in other Amazon Web Services Regions, run the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> command in each Amazon Web Services Region where you want to apply the same customizations. </p> </li> </ul>",

If the job fails, the <code>DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult</code> API returns detailed information about the error that occurred.</p> <p> <b>StartDashboardSnapshotJob API throttling</b> </p> <p>Amazon QuickSight utilizes API throttling to create a more consistent user experience within a time span for customers when they call the <code>StartDashboardSnapshotJob</code>. By default, 12 jobs can run simlutaneously in one Amazon Web Services account and users can submit up 10 API requests per second before an account is throttled. If an overwhelming number of API requests are made by the same user in a short period of time, Amazon QuickSight throttles the API calls to maintin an optimal experience and reliability for all Amazon QuickSight users.</p> <p> <b>Common throttling scenarios</b> </p> <p>The following list provides information about the most commin throttling scenarios that can occur.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>A large number of <code>SnapshotExport</code> API jobs are running simultaneously on an Amazon Web Services account.</b> When a new <code>StartDashboardSnapshotJob</code> is created and there are already 12 jobs with the <code>RUNNING</code> status, the new job request fails and returns a <code>LimitExceededException</code> error. Wait for a current job to comlpete before you resubmit the new job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>A large number of API requests are submitted on an Amazon Web Services account.</b> When a user makes more than 10 API calls to the Amazon QuickSight API in one second, a <code>ThrottlingException</code> is returned.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If your use case requires a higher throttling limit, contact your account admin or <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/\">Amazon Web ServicesSupport</a> to explore options to tailor a more optimal expereince for your account.</p> <p> <b>Best practices to handle throttling</b> </p> <p>If your use case projects high levels of API traffic, try to reduce the degree of frequency and parallelism of API calls as much as you can to avoid throttling. You can also perform a timing test to calculate an estimate for the total processing time of your projected load that stays within the throttling limits of the Amazon QuickSight APIs. For example, if your projected traffic is 100 snapshot jobs before 12:00 PM per day, start 12 jobs in parallel and measure the amount of time it takes to proccess all 12 jobs. Once you obtain the result, multiply the duration by 9, for example <code>(12 minutes * 9 = 108 minutes)</code>. Use the new result to determine the latest time at which the jobs need to be started to meet your target deadline.</p> <p>The time that it takes to process a job can be impacted by the following factors:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The dataset type (Direct Query or SPICE).</p> </li> <li> <p>The size of the dataset.</p> </li> <li> <p>The complexity of the calculated fields that are used in the dashboard.</p> </li> <li> <p>The number of visuals that are on a sheet.</p> </li> <li> <p>The types of visuals that are on the sheet.</p> </li> <li> <p>The number of formats and snapshots that are requested in the job configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p>The size of the generated snapshots.</p> </li> </ul>",

Then, you use the <code>RegisterUser</code> API operation to assign the named set of permissions to a Amazon QuickSight user. </p> <p>Amazon QuickSight custom permissions are applied through IAM policies. Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by assigning Amazon QuickSight users to one of the default security cohorts in Amazon QuickSight (admin, author, reader).</p> <p>This feature is available only to Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edition subscriptions.</p>",
