    "AcceptMatch": "<p>Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. </p> <p>When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.</p> <p>To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. </p> <p>If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed. </p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-client.html\"> Add FlexMatch to a Game Client</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-events.html\"> FlexMatch Events Reference</a> </p> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AcceptMatch</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchBackfill</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
    "ClaimGameServer": "<p> <b>This action is part of Amazon GameLift FleetIQ with game server groups, which is in preview release and is subject to change.</b> </p> <p>Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This action is called by a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ searches for an available game server in the specified game server group, places the game server in \"claimed\" status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information back to the requester so that players can connect to the game server. </p> <p>There are two ways you can claim a game server. For the first option, you provide a game server group ID only, which prompts GameLift FleetIQ to search for an available game server in the specified group and claim it. With this option, GameLift FleetIQ attempts to consolidate gameplay on as few instances as possible to minimize hosting costs. For the second option, you request a specific game server by its ID. This option results in a less efficient claiming process because it does not take advantage of consolidation and may fail if the requested game server is unavailable. </p> <p>To claim a game server, identify a game server group and (optionally) a game server ID. If your game requires that game data be provided to the game server at the start of a game, such as a game map or player information, you can provide it in your claim request. </p> <p>When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE, while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period allows the game server to be prompted to update its status to UTILIZED (using <a>UpdateGameServer</a>). If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request.</p> <p>If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases: (1) if the game server utilization status is UTILIZED, (2) if the game server claim status is CLAIMED, or (3) if the instance that the game server is running on is flagged as draining.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gsg-intro.html\">GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> </p> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>RegisterGameServer</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListGameServers</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ClaimGameServer</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeGameServer</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateGameServer</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeregisterGameServer</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateAlias": "<p>Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN.

You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift Console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.</p> <p>Prior creating a new game server group, you must set up the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>An EC2 launch template.

To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference the queue name.</p> <p> <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.</p> <p> <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. </p> <p>To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies.

    "PutScalingPolicy": "<p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html\">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.\"</p> <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created.

This action is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group. There are three reasons to update game server information: (1) to change the utilization status of the game server, (2) to report game server health status, and (3) to change game server metadata. A registered game server should regularly report health and should update utilization status when it is supporting gameplay so that GameLift FleetIQ can accurately track game server availability. You can make all three types of updates in the same request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>To update the game server's utilization status, identify the game server and game server group and specify the current utilization status. Use this status to identify when game servers are currently hosting games and when they are available to be claimed. </p> </li> <li> <p>To report health status, identify the game server and game server group and set health check to HEALTHY. If a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy and will be eventually de-registered from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data and custom sort key values.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps are updated.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gsg-intro.html\">GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> </p> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>RegisterGameServer</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListGameServers</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ClaimGameServer</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeGameServer</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateGameServer</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeregisterGameServer</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
