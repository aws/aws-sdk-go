Please update the IAM policy.</p> <p> <code>INTERNAL_ERROR</code> - Amazon Inspector has encountered an internal error for this resource. Amazon Inspector service will automatically resolve the issue and resume the scanning. No action required from the user.</p> <p> <code>UNMANAGED_EC2_INSTANCE</code> - The EC2 instance is not managed by SSM, please use the following SSM automation to remediate the issue: <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-troubleshoot-managed-instance.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-troubleshoot-managed-instance.html</a>.

The findings and coverage associated with this resource are in the process of being cleaned up.</p> <p> <code>SUCCESSFUL</code> - The scan was successful.</p> <p> <code>NO_RESOURCES_FOUND</code> - Reserved for future use.</p> <p> <code>IMAGE_SIZE_EXCEEDED</code> - Reserved for future use.</p> <p> <code>SCAN_FREQUENCY_MANUAL</code> - This image will not be covered by Amazon Inspector due to the repository scan frequency configuration.</p> <p> <code>SCAN_FREQUENCY_SCAN_ON_PUSH </code>- This image will be scanned one time and will not new findings because of the scan frequency configuration.</p> <p> <code>EC2_INSTANCE_STOPPED</code> - This EC2 instance is in a stopped state, therefore, Amazon Inspector will pause scanning. The existing findings will continue to exist until the instance is terminated. Once the instance is re-started, Inspector will automatically start scanning the instance again. Please note that you will not be charged for this instance while it’s in a stopped state.</p> <p> <code>PENDING_DISABLE</code> - This resource is pending cleanup during disablement. The customer will not be billed while a resource is in the pending disable status.</p> <p> <code>NO INVENTORY</code> - Amazon Inspector couldn’t find software application inventory to scan for vulnerabilities. This might be caused due to required Amazon Inspector associations being deleted or failing to run on your resource. Please verify the status of <code>InspectorInventoryCollection-do-not-delete</code> association in the SSM console for the resource. Additionally, you can verify the instance’s inventory in the SSM Fleet Manager console.</p> <p> <code>STALE_INVENTORY</code> - Amazon Inspector wasn’t able to collect an updated software application inventory in the last 7 days. Please confirm the required Amazon Inspector associations still exist and you can still see an updated inventory in the SSM console.</p> <p> <code>EXCLUDED_BY_TAG</code> - This resource was not scanned because it has been excluded by a tag.</p> <p> <code>UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME</code> - The function was not scanned because it has an unsupported runtime.

To resume Deep inspection for this instance you can try to adjust the custom paths associated with the account.</p> <p> <code>DEEP_INSPECTION_DAILY_SSM_INVENTORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED</code> - The SSM agent couldn't send inventory to Amazon Inspector because the SSM quota for Inventory data collected per instance per day has already been reached for this instance.</p> <p> <code>DEEP_INSPECTION_COLLECTION_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED</code> - Amazon Inspector failed to extract the package inventory because the package collection time exceeding the maximum threshold of 15 minutes.</p> <p> <code>DEEP_INSPECTION_NO_INVENTORY</code> The Amazon Inspector plugin hasn't yet been able to collect an inventory of packages for this instance. This is usually the result of a pending scan, however, if this status persists after 6 hours, use SSM to ensure that the required Amazon Inspector associations exist and are running for the instance.</p> <p/>"
