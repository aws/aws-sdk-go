  "service": "<fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics</fullname> <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services. You can create and manage <i>canaries</i>, which are modular, lightweight scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You can set up your canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted nodes in your applications. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html\">Using ServiceLens to Monitor the Health of Your Applications</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Before you create and manage canaries, be aware of the security considerations. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html\">Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries</a>.</p>",

    "CreateCanary": "<p>Creates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once. </p> <p>Do not use <code>CreateCanary</code> to modify an existing canary. Use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCanary.html\">UpdateCanary</a> instead.</p> <p>To create canaries, you must have the <code>CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess</code> policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the <code>iam:CreateRole</code>, <code>iam:CreatePolicy</code> and <code>iam:AttachRolePolicy</code> permissions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Roles\">Necessary Roles and Permissions</a>.</p> <p>Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet.

Using groups can help you with managing and automating your canaries, and you can also view aggregated run results and statistics for all canaries in a group. </p> <p>Groups are global resources. When you create a group, it is replicated across Amazon Web Services Regions, and you can view it and add canaries to it from any Region. Although the group ARN format reflects the Region name where it was created, a group is not constrained to any Region. This means that you can put canaries from multiple Regions into the same group, and then use that group to view and manage all of those canaries in a single view.</p> <p>Groups are supported in all Regions except the Regions that are disabled by default. For more information about these Regions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable\">Enabling a Region</a>.</p> <p>Each group can contain as many as 10 canaries.

You can specify a frequency between <code>rate(1 minute)</code> and <code>rate(1 hour)</code>.</p> <p>Specifying <code>rate(0 minute)</code> or <code>rate(0 hour)</code> is a special value that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.</p> <p>Use <code>cron(<i>expression</i>)</code> to specify a cron expression.
