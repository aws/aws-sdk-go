  "service": "<fullname>WAF</fullname> <note> <p>This is the latest version of the <b>WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like \"V2\" or \"v2\", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. </p> <p>For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html\">WAF Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response. </p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html\">WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html\">WAF endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p> </li> <li> <p>For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs\">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>",
  "operations": {
    "AssociateWebACL": "<p>Associates a web ACL with a regional application resource, to protect the resource. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p> <p>For Amazon CloudFront, don't use this call. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL, in the CloudFront call <code>UpdateDistribution</code>, set the web ACL ID to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL. For information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html\">UpdateDistribution</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>When you make changes to web ACLs or web ACL components, like rules and rule groups, WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and its components are stored and used. Your changes are applied within seconds, but there might be a brief period of inconsistency when the changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.</p>",
    "CheckCapacity": "<p>Returns the web ACL capacity unit (WCU) requirements for a specified scope and set of rules. You can use this to check the capacity requirements for the rules you want to use in a <a>RuleGroup</a> or <a>WebACL</a>. </p> <p>WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group.

This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements. </p>",
    "CreateWebACL": "<p>Creates a <a>WebACL</a> per the specifications provided.</p> <p> A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has an action defined (allow, block, or count) for requests that match the statement of the rule. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types <a>Rule</a>, <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p>",

Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.</p> <p> A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has an action defined (allow, block, or count) for requests that match the statement of the rule. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types <a>Rule</a>, <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p>"

You can define a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside a web ACL and inside a rule group. </p> <p>For additional information about the options, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html\">Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules</a> in the <i>WAF Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call <code>GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys</code>. This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.</p> <p>WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF. </p>"

This function uses up to two bytes in the decoding process, so it can help to uncover ASCII characters that were encoded using CSS encoding that wouldn’t typically be encoded. It's also useful in countering evasion, which is a combination of a backslash and non-hexadecimal characters. For example, <code>ja\\vascript</code> for javascript. </p> <p> <b>ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE</b> - Decode the following ANSI C escape sequences: <code>\\a</code>, <code>\\b</code>, <code>\\f</code>, <code>\\n</code>, <code>\\r</code>, <code>\\t</code>, <code>\\v</code>, <code>\\\\</code>, <code>\\?</code>, <code>\\'</code>, <code>\\\"</code>, <code>\\xHH</code> (hexadecimal), <code>\\0OOO</code> (octal). Encodings that aren't valid remain in the output. </p> <p> <b>HEX_DECODE</b> - Decode a string of hexadecimal characters into a binary.</p> <p> <b>HTML_ENTITY_DECODE</b> - Replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. <code>HTML_ENTITY_DECODE</code> performs these operations: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Replaces <code>(ampersand)quot;</code> with <code>\"</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Replaces <code>(ampersand)nbsp;</code> with a non-breaking space, decimal 160</p> </li> <li> <p>Replaces <code>(ampersand)lt;</code> with a \"less than\" symbol</p> </li> <li> <p>Replaces <code>(ampersand)gt;</code> with <code>&gt;</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, <code>(ampersand)#xhhhh;</code>, with the corresponding characters</p> </li> <li> <p>Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, <code>(ampersand)#nnnn;</code>, with the corresponding characters</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>JS_DECODE</b> - Decode JavaScript escape sequences. If a <code>\\</code> <code>u</code> <code>HHHH</code> code is in the full-width ASCII code range of <code>FF01-FF5E</code>, then the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. If not, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed, causing a possible loss of information. </p> <p> <b>LOWERCASE</b> - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z). </p> <p> <b>MD5</b> - Calculate an MD5 hash from the data in the input. The computed hash is in a raw binary form. </p> <p> <b>NONE</b> - Specify <code>NONE</code> if you don't want any text transformations. </p> <p> <b>NORMALIZE_PATH</b> - Remove multiple slashes, directory self-references, and directory back-references that are not at the beginning of the input from an input string. </p> <p> <b>NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN</b> - This is the same as <code>NORMALIZE_PATH</code>, but first converts backslash characters to forward slashes. </p> <p> <b>REMOVE_NULLS</b> - Remove all <code>NULL</code> bytes from the input. </p> <p> <b>REPLACE_COMMENTS</b> - Replace each occurrence of a C-style comment (<code>/* ... */</code>) with a single space. Multiple consecutive occurrences are not compressed. Unterminated comments are also replaced with a space (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone termination of a comment (<code>*/</code>) is not acted upon. </p> <p> <b>REPLACE_NULLS</b> - Replace NULL bytes in the input with space characters (ASCII <code>0x20</code>). </p> <p> <b>SQL_HEX_DECODE</b> - Decode SQL hex data. Example (<code>0x414243</code>) will be decoded to (<code>ABC</code>).</p> <p> <b>URL_DECODE</b> - Decode a URL-encoded value. </p> <p> <b>URL_DECODE_UNI</b> - Like <code>URL_DECODE</code>, but with support for Microsoft-specific <code>%u</code> encoding. If the code is in the full-width ASCII code range of <code>FF01-FF5E</code>, the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. Otherwise, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed. </p> <p> <b>UTF8_TO_UNICODE</b> - Convert all UTF-8 character sequences to Unicode. This helps input normalization, and minimizing false-positives and false-negatives for non-English languages.</p>"
