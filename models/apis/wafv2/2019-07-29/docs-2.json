  "service": "<fullname>WAF</fullname> <note> <p>This is the latest version of the <b>WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like \"V2\" or \"v2\", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. </p> <p>For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html\">WAF Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response. </p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html\">WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html\">WAF endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p> </li> <li> <p>For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs\">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>",

The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes. </p> <p>The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation: </p> <ul> <li> <p>After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable. </p> </li> <li> <p>After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.</p> </li> <li> <p>After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others. </p> </li> <li> <p>After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.</p> </li> </ul>",
    "CheckCapacity": "<p>Returns the web ACL capacity unit (WCU) requirements for a specified scope and set of rules. You can use this to check the capacity requirements for the rules you want to use in a <a>RuleGroup</a> or <a>WebACL</a>. </p> <p>WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group.

When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements. </p>",
    "CreateWebACL": "<p>Creates a <a>WebACL</a> per the specifications provided.</p> <p> A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF applies to requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types <a>Rule</a>, <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect.

The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>HTTP method POST: count 2</p> </li> <li> <p>HTTP method GET: count 2</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance.

You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule. </p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside another statement, for example inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or <code>OrStatement</code>. You can define a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside a web ACL and inside a rule group. </p> <p>For additional information about the options, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html\">Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules</a> in the <i>WAF Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call <code>GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys</code>. This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.</p> <p>WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF. </p>",

The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>HTTP method POST: count 2</p> </li> <li> <p>HTTP method GET: count 2</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individually. </p> <p>You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule. </p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside another statement, for example inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or <code>OrStatement</code>. You can define a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside a web ACL and inside a rule group. </p> <p>For additional information about the options, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html\">Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules</a> in the <i>WAF Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call <code>GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys</code>. This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.</p> <p>WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF. </p>"
