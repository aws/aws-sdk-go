This is useful for user context filtering, where search results are filtered based on the user or their group access to documents.</p> <p>You can use this to re-configure your existing document level access control without indexing all of your documents again. For example, your index contains top-secret company documents that only certain employees or users should access. One of these users leaves the company or switches to a team that should be blocked from accessing top-secret documents. The user still has access to top-secret documents because the user had access when your documents were previously indexed. You can create a specific access control configuration for the user with deny access. You can later update the access control configuration to allow access if the user returns to the company and re-joins the 'top-secret' team. You can re-configure access control for your documents as circumstances change.</p> <p>To apply your access control configuration to certain documents, you call the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_BatchPutDocument.html\">BatchPutDocument</a> API with the <code>AccessControlConfigurationId</code> included in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_Document.html\">Document</a> object.
