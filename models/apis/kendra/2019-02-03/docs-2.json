    "CreateAccessControlConfiguration": "<p>Creates an access configuration for your documents. This includes user and group access information for your documents. This is useful for user context filtering, where search results are filtered based on the user or their group access to documents.</p> <p>You can use this to re-configure your existing document level access control without indexing all of your documents again. For example, your index contains top-secret company documents that only certain employees or users should access. One of these users leaves the company or switches to a team that should be blocked from accessing top-secret documents. The user still has access to top-secret documents because the user had access when your documents were previously indexed. You can create a specific access control configuration for the user with deny access. You can later update the access control configuration to allow access if the user returns to the company and re-joins the 'top-secret' team. You can re-configure access control for your documents as circumstances change.</p> <p>To apply your access control configuration to certain documents, you call the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_BatchPutDocument.html\">BatchPutDocument</a> API with the <code>AccessControlConfigurationId</code> included in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_Document.html\">Document</a> object. If you use an S3 bucket as a data source, you update the <code>.metadata.json</code> with the <code>AccessControlConfigurationId</code> and synchronize your data source.
