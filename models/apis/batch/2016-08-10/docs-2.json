  "service": "<p>Using AWS Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch utilizes the advantages of this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure, while also adopting a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages, AWS Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.</p> <p>As a fully managed service, AWS Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With AWS Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems. </p>",
  "operations": {
    "CancelJob": "<p>Cancels a job in an AWS Batch job queue. Jobs that are in the <code>SUBMITTED</code>, <code>PENDING</code>, or <code>RUNNABLE</code> state are canceled. Jobs that have progressed to <code>STARTING</code> or <code>RUNNING</code> are not canceled (but the API operation still succeeds, even if no job is canceled); these jobs must be terminated with the <a>TerminateJob</a> operation.</p>",
    "CreateComputeEnvironment": "<p>Creates an AWS Batch compute environment. You can create <code>MANAGED</code> or <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute environments. <code>MANAGED</code> compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate resources. <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute environments can only use EC2 resources.</p> <p>In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html\">launch template</a> that you specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose either to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances, or to use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.</p> <note> <p>Multi-node parallel jobs are not supported on Spot Instances.</p> </note> <p>In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMI. However, you need to verify that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html\">container instance AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. After you have created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the <a>DescribeComputeEnvironments</a> operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, manually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html\">Launching an Amazon ECS container instance</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>AWS Batch doesn't upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it's created. For example, it doesn't update the AMIs when a newer version of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you're responsible for the management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your AWS Batch jobs, complete these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete the earlier compute environment.</p> </li> </ol> </note>",

For example, if a compute environment is associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.</p>",
    "DeleteComputeEnvironment": "<p>Deletes an AWS Batch compute environment.</p> <p>Before you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to <code>DISABLED</code> with the <a>UpdateComputeEnvironment</a> API operation and disassociate it from any job queues with the <a>UpdateJobQueue</a> API operation.
