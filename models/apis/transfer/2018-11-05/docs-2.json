AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.</p>",
