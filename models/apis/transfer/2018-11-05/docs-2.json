  "service": "<p>Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon EFS. Additionally, you can use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) to transfer files into and out of Amazon S3. Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.</p>",

For details on using passive mode (PASV) in a NAT environment, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/configuring-your-ftps-server-behind-a-firewall-or-nat-with-aws-transfer-family/\">Configuring your FTPS server behind a firewall or NAT with Transfer Family</a>. </p> </note> <p> <i>Special values</i> </p> <p>The <code>AUTO</code> and <code>0.0.0.0</code> are special values for the <code>PassiveIp</code> parameter. The value <code>PassiveIp=AUTO</code> is assigned by default to FTP and FTPS type servers. In this case, the server automatically responds with one of the endpoint IPs within the PASV response. <code>PassiveIp=0.0.0.0</code> has a more unique application for its usage. For example, if you have a High Availability (HA) Network Load Balancer (NLB) environment, where you have 3 subnets, you can only specify a single IP address using the <code>PassiveIp</code> parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having High Availability. In this case, you can specify <code>PassiveIp=0.0.0.0</code>. This tells the client to use the same IP address as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their connections. Note, however, that not all FTP clients support the <code>PassiveIp=0.0.0.0</code> response. FileZilla and WinSCP do support it. If you are using other clients, check to see if your client supports the <code>PassiveIp=0.0.0.0</code> response.</p>"
