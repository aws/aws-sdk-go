This API operation accepts the <code>TransformId</code> whose labels you want to export and an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path to export the labels to.

(Answering these questions is often called 'labeling' in the machine learning workflows). In the case of the <code>FindMatches</code> transform, these questions are of the form, “What is the correct way to group these rows together into groups composed entirely of matching records?” After the labeling process is finished, users upload their answers/labels with a call to <code>StartImportLabelsTaskRun</code>.
