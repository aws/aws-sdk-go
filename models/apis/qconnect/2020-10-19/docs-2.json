Because Amazon Q in Connect is built on Amazon Bedrock, users can take full advantage of the controls implemented in Amazon Bedrock to enforce safety, security, and the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI).</p> </note> <p>Amazon Q in Connect is a generative AI customer service assistant. It is an LLM-enhanced evolution of Amazon Connect Wisdom that delivers real-time recommendations to help contact center agents resolve customer issues quickly and accurately.</p> <p>Amazon Q in Connect automatically detects customer intent during calls and chats using conversational analytics and natural language understanding (NLU). It then provides agents with immediate, real-time generative responses and suggested actions, and links to relevant documents and articles. Agents can also query Amazon Q in Connect directly using natural language or keywords to answer customer requests.</p> <p>Use the Amazon Q in Connect APIs to create an assistant and a knowledge base, for example, or manage content by uploading custom files.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-q-connect.html\">Use Amazon Q in Connect for generative AI powered agent assistance in real-time</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</i>.</p>",
