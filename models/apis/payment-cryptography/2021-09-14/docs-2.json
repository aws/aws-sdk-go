Using this operation, you can share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated keys with other service partners to perform cryptographic operations outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography </p> <p>For symmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines. And for asymmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm . Asymmetric key exchange methods are typically used to establish bi-directional trust between the two parties exhanging keys and are used for initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK). After which you can export working keys using symmetric method to perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> <p>The TR-34 norm is intended for exchanging 3DES keys only and keys are imported in a WrappedKeyBlock format.

IPEK is generated from BDK (Base Derivation Key) and <code>ExportDukptInitialKey</code> attribute KSN (<code>KeySerialNumber</code>). The generated IPEK does not persist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and has to be re-generated each time during export.</p> <p> <b>To export KEK or IPEK using TR-34</b> </p> <p>Using this operation, you can export initial key using TR-34 asymmetric key exchange. You can only export KEK generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During key export process, KDH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which initiates key export and KRD is the user receiving the key.</p> <p>To initiate TR-34 key export, the KRD must obtain an export token by calling <a>GetParametersForExport</a>. This operation also generates a key pair for the purpose of key export, signs the key and returns back the signing public key certificate (also known as KDH signing certificate) and root certificate chain. The KDH uses the private key to sign the the export payload and the signing public key certificate is provided to KRD to verify the signature. The KRD can import the root certificate into its Hardware Security Module (HSM), as required. The export token and the associated KDH signing certificate expires after 7 days. </p> <p>Next the KRD generates a key pair for the the purpose of encrypting the KDH key and provides the public key cerificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) back to KDH. The KRD will also import the root cerificate chain into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling <a>ImportKey</a> for <code>RootCertificatePublicKey</code>. The KDH, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, will use the KRD wrapping cerificate to encrypt (wrap) the key under export and signs it with signing private key to generate a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock.
