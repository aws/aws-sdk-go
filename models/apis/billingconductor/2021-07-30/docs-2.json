Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't change the way you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design. Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to configure, generate, and display rates to certain customers over a given billing period. You can also analyze the difference between the rates you apply to your accounting groupings relative to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see the custom rate applied on the billing details page of the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing\">Amazon Web Services Billing console</a>, or configure a cost and usage report per billing group.</p> <p>This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor using its API. For more information about using the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/enterprisebilling/\">Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor</a> user interface, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enterprisebilling/6b7c01c5-b592-467e-9769-90052eaf359c/userguide/what-is-enterprisebilling.html\"> Amazon Web Services Enterprise Billing Console User Guide</a>.</p>",
