    "CompareFaces": "<p>Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image. </p> <p> If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image. </p> <note> <p>CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use <code>CompareFaces</code> to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.</p> </note> <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p> <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p> <note> <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p> </note> <p> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.</p> <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that donâ€™t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p> <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p> <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p> <note> <p> This is a stateless API operation.

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p> For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a (<code>CustomLabel</code>) object in an array (<code>CustomLabels</code>). Each <code>CustomLabel</code> object provides the label name (<code>Name</code>), the level of confidence that the image contains the object (<code>Confidence</code>), and object location information, if it exists, for the label on the image (<code>Geometry</code>). </p> <p>During training model calculates a threshold value that determines if a prediction for a label is true. By default, <code>DetectCustomLabels</code> doesn't return labels whose confidence value is below the model's calculated threshold value. To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for <code>MinConfidence</code> that is higher than the model's calculated threshold. You can get the model's calculated threshold from the model's training results shown in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console. To get all labels, regardless of confidence, specify a <code>MinConfidence</code> value of 0. </p> <p>You can also add the <code>MaxResults</code> parameter to limit the number of labels returned. </p> <p>This is a stateless API operation.

The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. </p> <p> <code>{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p>In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.</p> <p>In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify <code>MinConfidence</code> to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%.

An <code>Instance</code> object contains a <a>BoundingBox</a> object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.</p> <p> <code>DetectLabels</code> also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label <i>car</i>. The label <i>car</i> has two parent labels: <i>Vehicle</i> (its parent) and <i>Transportation</i> (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, <i>Car</i>, <i>Vehicle</i>, and <i>Transportation</i> are returned as unique labels in the response. </p> <p>This is a stateless API operation.

    "IndexFaces": "<p>Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection. </p> <p>Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the <a>SearchFaces</a> and <a>SearchFacesByImage</a> operations.</p> <p>For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <p>To get the number of faces in a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>. </p> <p>If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, <code>IndexFaces</code> indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image.
