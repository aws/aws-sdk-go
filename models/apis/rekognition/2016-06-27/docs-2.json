  "operations": {
    "CompareFaces": "<p>Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image. </p> <p> If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image. </p> <note> <p>CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use <code>CompareFaces</code> to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.</p> </note> <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p> <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, roll, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p> <note> <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p> </note> <p> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.</p> <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p> <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p> <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p> <note> <p> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.</p> </note> <p>For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code> action.</p>",
    "CopyProjectVersion": "<p>Copies a version of an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model from a source project to a destination project. The source and destination projects can be in different AWS accounts but must be in the same AWS Region. You can't copy a model to another AWS service. </p> <p>To copy a model version to a different AWS account, you need to create a resource-based policy known as a <i>project policy</i>. You attach the project policy to the source project by calling <a>PutProjectPolicy</a>. The project policy gives permission to copy the model version from a trusting AWS account to a trusted account.</p> <p>For more information creating and attaching a project policy, see Attaching a project policy (SDK) in the <i>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you are copying a model version to a project in the same AWS account, you don't need to create a project policy.</p> <note> <p>To copy a model, the destination project, source project, and source model version must already exist.</p> </note> <p>Copying a model version takes a while to complete. To get the current status, call <a>DescribeProjectVersions</a> and check the value of <code>Status</code> in the <a>ProjectVersionDescription</a> object.

A user can then index faces using the <code>IndexFaces</code> operation and persist results in a specific collection. Then, a user can search the collection for faces in the user-specific container. </p> <p>When you create a collection, it is associated with the latest version of the face model version.</p> <note> <p>Collection names are case-sensitive.</p> </note> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CreateCollection</code> action. If you want to tag your collection, you also require permission to perform the <code>rekognition:TagResource</code> operation.</p>",

You can create a dataset by using an Amazon Sagemaker format manifest file or by copying an existing Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels dataset.</p> <p>To create a training dataset for a project, specify <code>train</code> for the value of <code>DatasetType</code>. To create the test dataset for a project, specify <code>test</code> for the value of <code>DatasetType</code>. </p> <p>The response from <code>CreateDataset</code> is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the dataset. Creating a dataset takes a while to complete. Use <a>DescribeDataset</a> to check the current status. The dataset created successfully if the value of <code>Status</code> is <code>CREATE_COMPLETE</code>. </p> <p>To check if any non-terminal errors occurred, call <a>ListDatasetEntries</a> and check for the presence of <code>errors</code> lists in the JSON Lines.</p> <p>Dataset creation fails if a terminal error occurs (<code>Status</code> = <code>CREATE_FAILED</code>). Currently, you can't access the terminal error information. </p> <p>For more information, see Creating dataset in the <i>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CreateDataset</code> action.

    "CreateFaceLivenessSession": "<p>This API operation initiates a Face Liveness session. It returns a <code>SessionId</code>, which you can use to start streaming Face Liveness video and get the results for a Face Liveness session. You can use the <code>OutputConfig</code> option in the Settings parameter to provide an Amazon S3 bucket location. The Amazon S3 bucket stores reference images and audit images. You can use <code>AuditImagesLimit</code> to limit the number of audit images returned. This number is between 0 and 4. By default, it is set to 0. The limit is best effort and based on the duration of the selfie-video. </p>",
    "CreateProject": "<p>Creates a new Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project.

For more information, see Creating training and test dataset in the <i>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide</i>. </p> <note> <p>You can train a model in a project that doesn't have associated datasets by specifying manifest files in the <code>TrainingData</code> and <code>TestingData</code> fields. </p> <p>If you open the console after training a model with manifest files, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels creates the datasets for you using the most recent manifest files. You can no longer train a model version for the project by specifying manifest files. </p> <p>Instead of training with a project without associated datasets, we recommend that you use the manifest files to create training and test datasets for the project.</p> </note> <p>Training takes a while to complete. You can get the current status by calling <a>DescribeProjectVersions</a>. Training completed successfully if the value of the <code>Status</code> field is <code>TRAINING_COMPLETED</code>.</p> <p>If training fails, see Debugging a failed model training in the <i>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</i> developer guide. </p> <p>Once training has successfully completed, call <a>DescribeProjectVersions</a> to get the training results and evaluate the model. For more information, see Improving a trained Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model in the <i>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</i> developers guide. </p> <p>After evaluating the model, you start the model by calling <a>StartProjectVersion</a>.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CreateProjectVersion</code> action.</p>",
    "CreateStreamProcessor": "<p>Creates an Amazon Rekognition stream processor that you can use to detect and recognize faces or to detect labels in a streaming video.</p> <p>Amazon Rekognition Video is a consumer of live video from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. There are two different settings for stream processors in Amazon Rekognition: detecting faces and detecting labels.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you are creating a stream processor for detecting faces, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (<code>Input</code>) and a Kinesis data stream (<code>Output</code>) stream for receiving the output. You must use the <code>FaceSearch</code> option in <code>Settings</code>, specifying the collection that contains the faces you want to recognize.

The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p> For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a (<code>CustomLabel</code>) object in an array (<code>CustomLabels</code>). Each <code>CustomLabel</code> object provides the label name (<code>Name</code>), the level of confidence that the image contains the object (<code>Confidence</code>), and object location information, if it exists, for the label on the image (<code>Geometry</code>). </p> <p>To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for <code>MinConfidence</code>. <code>DetectCustomLabelsLabels</code> only returns labels with a confidence that's higher than the specified value. The value of <code>MinConfidence</code> maps to the assumed threshold values created during training. For more information, see <i>Assumed threshold</i> in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels metrics expresses an assumed threshold as a floating point value between 0-1. The range of <code>MinConfidence</code> normalizes the threshold value to a percentage value (0-100). Confidence responses from <code>DetectCustomLabels</code> are also returned as a percentage. You can use <code>MinConfidence</code> to change the precision and recall or your model. For more information, see <i>Analyzing an image</i> in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. </p> <p>If you don't specify a value for <code>MinConfidence</code>, <code>DetectCustomLabels</code> returns labels based on the assumed threshold of each label.</p> <p>This is a stateless API operation.

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p> <b>Optional Parameters</b> </p> <p>You can specify one or both of the <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> and <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES</code> feature types when calling the DetectLabels API. Including <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> will ensure the response includes the labels detected in the input image, while including <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES </code>will ensure the response includes information about the image quality and color.</p> <p>When using <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> and/or <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES</code> you can provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/labels-detect-labels-image.html\">Detecting Labels in an Image</a>.</p> <p>You can specify <code>MinConfidence</code> to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the <code>MaxLabels</code> parameter to limit the number of labels returned. The default and upper limit is 1000 labels.</p> <p> <b>Response Elements</b> </p> <p> For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. The API returns the following types of information about labels:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Name - The name of the detected label. </p> </li> <li> <p> Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object. </p> </li> <li> <p> Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. DetectLabels returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response. </p> </li> <li> <p> Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label. </p> </li> <li> <p> Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to. </p> </li> <li> <p> BoundingBox — Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels, returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box. </p> </li> </ul> <p> The API returns the following information regarding the image, as part of the ImageProperties structure:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Quality - Information about the Sharpness, Brightness, and Contrast of the input image, scored between 0 to 100. Image quality is returned for the entire image, as well as the background and the foreground. </p> </li> <li> <p>Dominant Color - An array of the dominant colors in the image. </p> </li> <li> <p>Foreground - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s foreground. </p> </li> <li> <p>Background - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s background.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The list of returned labels will include at least one label for every detected object, along with information about that label. In the following example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object, as well as the confidence in the label:</p> <p> <code>{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}</code> </p> <p> <code> {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}</code> </p> <p>The list of labels can include multiple labels for the same object. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. </p> <p> <code>{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p>In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.</p> <note> <p>If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the <a>DetectFaces</a> operation provides.</p> </note> <p>This is a stateless API operation that doesn't return any data.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectLabels</code> action. </p>",
