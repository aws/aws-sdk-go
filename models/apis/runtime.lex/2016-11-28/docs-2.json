  "service": "<p>Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides a set of operations (API). Your application uses the runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example, suppose user says \"I want pizza\", your application sends this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the application). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the application to elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created the application). You use the build-time API to create and manage your Amazon Lex applications. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time API. . </p>",

For example, consider the following response messages: </p> <ul> <li> <p>\"What pizza toppings would you like?\" – In this case, the <code>dialogState</code> would be <code>ElicitSlot</code> (that is, a user response is expected). </p> </li> <li> <p>\"Your order has been placed.\" – In this case, Amazon Lex returns one of the following <code>dialogState</code> values depending on how the intent fulfillment is configured (see <code>fulfillmentActivity</code> in <code>CreateIntent</code>): </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>FulFilled</code> – The intent fulfillment is configured through a Lambda function. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ReadyForFulfilment</code> – The intent's <code>fulfillmentActivity</code> is to simply return the intent data back to the client application. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"

If Amazon Lex doesn't understand the intent, it returns this <code>dialogState</code>. Another example is when your intent is configured with a follow up prompt. For example, after OrderPizza intent is fulfilled, the intent might have a follow up prompt such as \" Do you want to order a drink or desert?\" In this case, Amazon Lex returns this <code>dialogState</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ConfirmIntent</code> – Amazon Lex is expecting a yes/no response from the user indicating whether to go ahead and fulfill the intent (for example, OK to go ahead and order the pizza). In addition to a yes/no reply, the user might provide a response with additional slot information (either new slot information or changes to the existing slot values). For example, \"Yes, but change to thick crust.\" Amazon Lex understands the additional information and updates the intent slots accordingly. </p> <p> Consider another example. Before fulfilling an order, your application might prompt for confirmation such as \"Do you want to place this pizza order?\" A user might reply with \"No, I want to order a drink.\" Amazon Lex recognizes the new OrderDrink intent. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ElicitSlot</code> – Amazon Lex is expecting a value of a slot for the current intent. For example, suppose Amazon Lex asks, \"What size pizza would you like?\" A user might reply with \"Medium pepperoni pizza.\" Amazon Lex recognizes the size and the topping as the two separate slot values. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Fulfilled</code> – Conveys that the Lambda function has successfully fulfilled the intent. If Lambda function returns a statement/message to convey the fulfillment result, Amazon Lex passes this string to the client. If not, Amazon Lex looks for <code>conclusionStatement</code> that you configured for the intent. </p> <p> If both the Lambda function statement and the <code>conclusionStatement</code> are missing, Amazon Lex throws a bad request exception. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ReadyForFulfillment</code> – conveys that the client has to do the fulfillment work for the intent. This is the case when the current intent is configured with <code>ReturnIntent</code> as the <code>fulfillmentActivity </code>, where Amazon Lex returns this state to client. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Failed</code> – Conversation with the user failed. Some of the reasons for this <code>dialogState</code> are: after the configured number of attempts the user didn't provide an appropriate response, or the Lambda function failed to fulfill an intent. </p> </li> </ul>"
