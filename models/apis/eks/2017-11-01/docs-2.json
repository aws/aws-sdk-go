Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single-tenant and unique and runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.</p> <p>The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the worker nodes (for example, to support <code>kubectl exec</code>, <code>logs</code>, and <code>proxy</code> data flows).</p> <p>Amazon EKS worker nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.</p> <p>You can use the <code>endpointPublicAccess</code> and <code>endpointPrivateAccess</code> parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint.

This declaration is done through the profileâ€™s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.</p> <p>When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/\">Role Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) for authorization so that the <code>kubelet</code> that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node.
