Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.</p> <p>The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support <code>kubectl exec</code>, <code>logs</code>, and <code>proxy</code> data flows).</p> <p>Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.</p> <p>You can use the <code>endpointPublicAccess</code> and <code>endpointPrivateAccess</code> parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint.

    "CreateFargateProfile": "<p>Creates an Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods on Fargate.</p> <p>The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profile’s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.</p> <p>When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/\">Role Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) for authorization so that the <code>kubelet</code> that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-execution-role.html\">Pod Execution Role</a> in the <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Fargate profiles are immutable.

The environment variables configure the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including the Command Line Interface, to use the EKS Pod Identity credentials.</p> <p>Pod Identity is a simpler method than <i>IAM roles for service accounts</i>, as this method doesn't use OIDC identity providers.
