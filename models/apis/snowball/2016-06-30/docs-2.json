The Snow commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snow Family Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device, you'll need to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or AWS OpsHub for Snow Family. For more information, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html\">User Guide</a>.</p>",
