// You call this operation to inform Amazon Glacier that all the archive parts

// Amazon Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource.
// Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an
// archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive
// at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of
// archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.
//
// In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire
// archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree
// hash, see Computing Checksums (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).
// On the server side, Amazon Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of
// the assembled archive. If the values match, Amazon Glacier saves the archive
// to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The
// ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart
// upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can
// be used to debug a bad checksum issue.
//
// Additionally, Amazon Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges
// when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Amazon
// Glacier returns an error and the operation fails.
//
// Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful
// complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short
// period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is
// useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted
// connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your
// Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating
// duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes,
// you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not
// appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is
// possible.

//
//   Get job details You can make a DescribeJob request to obtain job status
// information while a job is in progress. However, it is more efficient to
// use an Amazon SNS notification to determine when a job is complete.
//
//   The information you get via notification is same that you get by calling
// DescribeJob.
//
// If for a specific event, you add both the notification configuration on
// the vault and also specify an SNS topic in your initiate job request, Amazon
// Glacier sends both notifications. For more information, see SetVaultNotifications.

// An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
// However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions
// by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

//
// About the Vault Inventory
//
// Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically, every
// 24 hours. When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns
// the last inventory for the vault. The inventory data you get might be up
// to a day or two days old. Also, the initiate inventory job might take some
// time to complete before you can download the vault inventory. So you do not
// want to retrieve a vault inventory for each vault operation. However, in
// some scenarios, you might find the vault inventory useful. For example, when
// you upload an archive, you can provide an archive description but not an
// archive name. Amazon Glacier provides you a unique archive ID, an opaque
// string of characters. So, you might maintain your own database that maps
// archive names to their corresponding Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs.
// You might find the vault inventory useful in the event you need to reconcile
// information in your database with the actual vault inventory.
//
// Range Inventory Retrieval
//
// You can limit the number of inventory items retrieved by filtering on the
// archive creation date or by setting a limit.
//
// Filtering by Archive Creation Date
//
// You can retrieve inventory items for archives created between StartDate
// and EndDate by specifying values for these parameters in the InitiateJob
// request. Archives created on or after the StartDate and before the EndDate
// will be returned. If you only provide the StartDate without the EndDate,
// you will retrieve the inventory for all archives created on or after the
// StartDate. If you only provide the EndDate without the StartDate, you will
// get back the inventory for all archives created before the EndDate.
//
// Limiting Inventory Items per Retrieval
//
// You can limit the number of inventory items returned by setting the Limit
// parameter in the InitiateJob request. The inventory job output will contain
// inventory items up to the specified Limit. If there are more inventory items
// available, the result is paginated. After a job is complete you can use the
// DescribeJob operation to get a marker that you use in a subsequent InitiateJob
// request. The marker will indicate the starting point to retrieve the next
// set of inventory items. You can page through your entire inventory by repeatedly
// making InitiateJob requests with the marker from the previous DescribeJob
// output, until you get a marker from DescribeJob that returns null, indicating
// that there are no more inventory items available.
//
// You can use the Limit parameter together with the date range parameters.
//
// About Ranged Archive Retrieval
//
//  You can initiate an archive retrieval for the whole archive or a range
// of the archive. In the case of ranged archive retrieval, you specify a byte
// range to return or the whole archive. The range specified must be megabyte
// (MB) aligned, that is the range start value must be divisible by 1 MB and
// range end value plus 1 must be divisible by 1 MB or equal the end of the
// archive. If the ranged archive retrieval is not megabyte aligned, this operation
// returns a 400 response. Furthermore, to ensure you get checksum values for
// data you download using Get Job Output API, the range must be tree hash aligned.

// This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon Glacier creates a multipart
// upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload
// ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see UploadMultipartPart).
//
// When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number
// of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power
// of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608
// (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum
// is 4 GB.
//
// Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart), except
// the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size
// or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you
// initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four
// parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.
//
// You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart
// upload because Amazon Glacier does not require you to specify the overall
// archive size.
//
// After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier removes the multipart
// upload resource referenced by the ID. Amazon Glacier also removes the multipart

// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).

//   Part size does not matchThe size of each part except the last must match
// the size specified in the corresponding InitiateMultipartUpload request.
// The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the
// specified size.
//
// If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified
// in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part,
// then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete
// Multipart Upload request will fail.
//
//   Range does not alignThe byte range value in the request does not align
// with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example,
// if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes
// (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges.
