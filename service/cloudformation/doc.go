// Package cloudformation provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS CloudFormation.
//
// CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure
// deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage
// Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon
// Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing,
// and Auto Scaling to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective
// applications without creating or configuring the underlying Amazon Web Services
// infrastructure.
//
// With CloudFormation, you declare all your resources and dependencies in a
// template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single
// unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources
// of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources
// for you.
//
// For more information about CloudFormation, see the CloudFormation product
// page (http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
//
// CloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services products. If you need
// additional technical information about a specific Amazon Web Services product,
// you can find the product's technical documentation at docs.aws.amazon.com
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS CloudFormation with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
