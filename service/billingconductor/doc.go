// Package billingconductor provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWSBillingConductor.
//
// Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that you
// can use to customize a pro forma (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/understanding-eb.html#eb-other-definitions)
// version of your billing data each month, to accurately show or chargeback
// your end customers. Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't change
// the way you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design. Instead,
// it provides you with a mechanism to configure, generate, and display rates
// to certain customers over a given billing period. You can also analyze the
// difference between the rates you apply to your accounting groupings relative
// to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon
// Web Services Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also
// see the custom rate applied on the billing details page of the Amazon Web
// Services Billing console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing), or configure
// a cost and usage report per billing group.
//
// This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web Services Billing
// Conductor using its API. For more information about using the Amazon Web
// Services Billing Conductor (https://console.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/)
// user interface, see the Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/what-is-billingconductor.html).

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWSBillingConductor with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
