// Package wafv2 provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS WAFV2.
//
//
// This is the latest version of the AWS WAF API, released in November, 2019.
// The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints
// and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2",
// to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources
// to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.
//
// If you used AWS WAF prior to this release, you can't use this AWS WAFV2 API
// to access any AWS WAF resources that you created before. You can access your
// old rules, web ACLs, and other AWS WAF resources only through the AWS WAF
// Classic APIs. The AWS WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints,
// and namespaces.
//
// For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources to this
// version, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html).
//
// AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and
// HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway
// API, or an Application Load Balancer. AWS WAF also lets you control access
// to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses
// that requests originate from or the values of query strings, API Gateway,
// CloudFront, or the Application Load Balancer responds to requests either
// with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You
// also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request
// is blocked.
//
// This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS
// WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about AWS
// WAF features and an overview of how to use AWS WAF, see the AWS WAF Developer
// Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/).
//
// You can make API calls using the endpoints listed in AWS Service Endpoints
// for AWS WAF (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#waf_region).
//
//    * For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list.
//    A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or an
//    API Gateway stage.
//
//    * For AWS CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed
//    for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.
//
// Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored
// to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information,
// see AWS SDKs (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).
//
// We currently provide two versions of the AWS WAF API: this API and the prior
// versions, the classic AWS WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality
// as the older versions, with the following major improvements:
//
//    * You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you
//    need to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set it
//    to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL.
//
//    * You can define a Web ACL or rule group with a single API call, and update
//    it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format,
//    and pass them to your rule group or Web ACL API calls.
//
//    * The limits AWS WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects
//    the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings,
//    so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS WAFV2 with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
