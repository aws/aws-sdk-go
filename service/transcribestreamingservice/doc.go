// Package transcribestreamingservice provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Transcribe Streaming Service.
//
// Amazon Transcribe streaming offers three main types of real-time transcription:
// Standard, Medical, and Call Analytics.
//
//   - Standard transcriptions are the most common option. Refer to for details.
//
//   - Medical transcriptions are tailored to medical professionals and incorporate
//     medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient
//     dialogue in real time, so doctors can focus on their patient instead of
//     taking notes. Refer to for details.
//
//   - Call Analytics transcriptions are designed for use with call center
//     audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer
//     service calls, use this option. Refer to for details.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/transcribe-streaming-2017-10-26 for more information on this service.
