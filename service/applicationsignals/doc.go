// Package applicationsignals provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals.
//
// This is a Preview release of the Application Signals API Reference. Operations
// and parameters are subject to change before the general availability release.
//
// Use CloudWatch Application Signals for comprehensive observability of your
// cloud-based applications. It enables real-time service health dashboards
// and helps you track long-term performance trends against your business goals.
// The application-centric view provides you with unified visibility across
// your applications, services, and dependencies, so you can proactively monitor
// and efficiently triage any issues that may arise, ensuring optimal customer
// experience.
//
// Application Signals provides the following benefits:
//
//   - Automatically collect metrics and traces from your applications, and
//     display key metrics such as call volume, availability, latency, faults,
//     and errors.
//
//   - Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs).
//
//   - See a map of your application topology that Application Signals automatically
//     discovers, that gives you a visual representation of your applications,
//     dependencies, and their connectivity.
