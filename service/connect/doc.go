// Package connect provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Connect Service.
//
// Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that makes it easy
// to set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer
// engagement at any scale.
//
// Amazon Connect provides rich metrics and real-time reporting that allow you
// to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more efficiently
// by putting customers in touch with the right agents.
//
// There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create
// and limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For more
// information, see Amazon Connect Service Quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html)
// in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.
//
// To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. For a
// list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see Amazon Connect Endpoints (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html).

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Connect Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
