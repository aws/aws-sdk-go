// Package signer provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Signer.
//
// With code signing for IoT, you can sign code that you create for any IoT
// device that is supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Code signing is available
// through Amazon FreeRTOS (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/)
// and AWS IoT Device Management (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/),
// and integrated with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/).
// In order to sign code, you import a third-party code signing certificate
// with ACM that is used to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device
// Management. For general information about using code signing, see the Code
// Signing for IoT Developer Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).

// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Signer with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
