// Package cloudwatchrum provides the client and types for making API
// requests to CloudWatch RUM.
//
// With Amazon CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real-user monitoring to collect
// client-side data about your web application performance from actual user
// sessions in real time. The data collected includes page load times, client-side
// errors, and user behavior. When you view this data, you can see it all aggregated
// together and also see breakdowns by the browsers and devices that your customers
// use.
//
// You can use the collected data to quickly identify and debug client-side
// performance issues. CloudWatch RUM helps you visualize anomalies in your
// application performance and find relevant debugging data such as error messages,
// stack traces, and user sessions. You can also use RUM to understand the range
// of end-user impact including the number of users, geolocations, and browsers
// used.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/rum-2018-05-10 for more information on this service.

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact CloudWatch RUM with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
