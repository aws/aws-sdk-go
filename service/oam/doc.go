// Package oam provides the client and types for making API
// requests to CloudWatch Observability Access Manager.
//
// Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage links
// between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using CloudWatch cross-account
// observability. With CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can monitor
// and troubleshoot applications that span multiple accounts within a Region.
// Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics, logs, and traces
// in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries.
//
//	<p>Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as <i>monitoring accounts</i>
//	and link them with multiple <i>source accounts</i>. A monitoring account
//	is a central Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with
//	observability data generated from source accounts. A source account is
//	an individual Amazon Web Services account that generates observability
//	data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts share their
//	observability data with the monitoring account. The shared observability
//	data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch
//	Logs, and traces in X-Ray.</p>

// To contact CloudWatch Observability Access Manager with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
