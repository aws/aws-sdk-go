// Package dataexchange provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Data Exchange.
//
// AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to exchange
// data in the cloud. You can use the AWS Data Exchange APIs to create, update,
// manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS Cloud.
//
// As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that you have an entitlement
// to through a subscription. You can use the APIS to download or copy your
// entitled data sets to Amazon S3 for use across a variety of AWS analytics
// and machine learning services.
//
// As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would like
// to publish to a product. Being able to package and provide your data sets
// into products requires a few steps to determine eligibility. For more information,
// visit the AWS Data Exchange User Guide.
//
// A data set is a collection of data that can be changed or updated over time.
// Data sets can be updated using revisions, which represent a new version or
// incremental change to a data set. A revision contains one or more assets.
// An asset in AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data that can be stored as an
// Amazon S3 object. The asset can be a structured data file, an image file,
// or some other data file. Jobs are asynchronous import or export operations
// used to create or copy assets.

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Data Exchange with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
