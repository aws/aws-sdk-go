// requests to Amazon Q Connect.
//
// Powered by Amazon Bedrock: Amazon Web Services implements automated abuse
// detection (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/abuse-detection.html).
// Because Amazon Q in Connect is built on Amazon Bedrock, users can take full
// advantage of the controls implemented in Amazon Bedrock to enforce safety,
// security, and the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI).
//
// Amazon Q in Connect is a generative AI customer service assistant. It is
// an LLM-enhanced evolution of Amazon Connect Wisdom that delivers real-time
// recommendations to help contact center agents resolve customer issues quickly
// and accurately.
//
// Amazon Q in Connect automatically detects customer intent during calls and
// chats using conversational analytics and natural language understanding (NLU).
// It then provides agents with immediate, real-time generative responses and
// suggested actions, and links to relevant documents and articles. Agents can
// also query Amazon Q in Connect directly using natural language or keywords
// to answer customer requests.
//
// Use the Amazon Q in Connect APIs to create an assistant and a knowledge base,
// for example, or manage content by uploading custom files.
//
