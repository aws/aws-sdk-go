// Package support provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Support.
//
// The Amazon Web Services Support API Reference is intended for programmers
// who need detailed information about the Amazon Web Services Support operations
// and data types. You can use the API to manage your support cases programmatically.
// The Amazon Web Services Support API uses HTTP methods that return results
// in JSON format.
//
//   - You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
//     plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
//
//   - If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that
//     does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan,
//     the SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information
//     about changing your support plan, see Amazon Web Services Support (http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).
//
// The Amazon Web Services Support service also exposes a set of Trusted Advisor
// (http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/) features. You can
// retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify
// checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.
//
// The following list describes the Amazon Web Services Support case management
// operations:
//
//   - Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels - The
//     DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels operations return Amazon Web
//     Services service names, service codes, service categories, and problem
//     severity levels. You use these values when you call the CreateCase operation.
//
//   - Case creation, case details, and case resolution - The CreateCase, DescribeCases,
//     DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase operations create Amazon Web Services
//     Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.
//
//   - Case communication - The DescribeCommunications, AddCommunicationToCase,
//     and AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add communications and
//     attachments to Amazon Web Services Support cases.
//
// The following list describes the operations available from the Amazon Web
// Services Support service for Trusted Advisor:
//
//   - DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run against
//     your Amazon Web Services resources.
//
//   - Using the checkId for a specific check returned by DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks,
//     you can call DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for
//     the check that you specified.
//
//   - DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for
//     one or more Trusted Advisor checks.
//
//   - RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified
//     check.
//
//   - DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status
//     of one or more checks.
//
// For authentication of requests, Amazon Web Services Support uses Signature
// Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
//
// See About the Amazon Web Services Support API (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html)

// use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call
// Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Support with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
