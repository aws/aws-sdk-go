// Package amplify provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Amplify.
//
// Welcome to the AWS Amplify API documentation. This reference provides descriptions
// of the actions and data types for the Amplify API.
//
// Amplify enables developers to develop and deploy cloud-powered mobile and
// web apps. The Amplify Console provides a continuous delivery and hosting
// service for web applications. For more information, see the Amplify Console
// User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
// The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools, and
// documentation for client app development. For more information, see the Amplify
// Framework. (https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/)
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/amplify-2017-07-25 for more information on this service.
//
// See amplify package documentation for more information.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/amplify/
//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Amplify with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
