// Package servicequotas provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Service Quotas.
//
// Service Quotas is a web service that you can use to manage many of your AWS
// service quotas. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum values
// for a resource, item, or operation. This guide provide descriptions of the
// Service Quotas actions that you can call from an API. For the Service Quotas
// user guide, which explains how to use Service Quotas from the console, see
// What is Service Quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html).
//
// AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for programming
// languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc...,). The SDKs
// provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Service Quotas
// and AWS. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and
// install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws.amazon.com/tools)
// page.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/service-quotas-2019-06-24 for more information on this service.

// See servicequotas package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Service Quotas with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// information on creating client for this service.
