// With Service Quotas, you can view and manage your quotas easily as your Amazon
// Web Services workloads grow. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the
// maximum number of resources that you can create in your Amazon Web Services
// account. For more information, see the Service Quotas User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/).

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Service Quotas with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
