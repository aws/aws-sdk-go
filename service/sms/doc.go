//
// We recommend Amazon Web Services Application Migration Service (http://aws.amazon.com/application-migration-service)
// (Amazon Web Services MGN) as the primary migration service for lift-and-shift
// migrations. If Amazon Web Services MGN is unavailable in a specific Amazon
// Web Services Region, you can use the Server Migration Service APIs through
// March 2023.
//
// Server Migration Service (Server Migration Service) makes it easier and faster
// for you to migrate your on-premises workloads to Amazon Web Services. To
