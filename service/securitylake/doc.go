// Amazon Security Lake is a fully-managed security data lake service. You can
// use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from cloud, on-premises,
// and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in your account. Security
// Lake helps you analyze security data, so you can get a more complete understanding
// of your security posture across the entire organization and improve the protection
// of your workloads, applications, and data.
//
// The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets,
// and you retain ownership over your data.
//
// Security Lake automates the collection of security-related log and event
// data from integrated Amazon Web Services. and third-party services and manages
// the lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings.
// Security Lake also converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and
// a standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework
// (OCSF).
//
// Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can subscribe to the data
// that's stored in Security Lake for incident response and security data analytics.
