// Package ram provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Resource Access Manager.
//
// This is the Resource Access Manager API Reference. This documentation provides
// descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM
// is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources
// across Amazon Web Services accounts and within your organization or organizational
// units (OUs) in Organizations. For supported resource types, you can also
// share resources with IAM roles and IAM users. If you have multiple Amazon
// Web Services accounts, you can use RAM to share those resources with other
// accounts.
//
// To learn more about RAM, see the following resources:
//
//    * Resource Access Manager product page (http://aws.amazon.com/ram)
//
//    * Resource Access Manager User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/)

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Resource Access Manager with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
