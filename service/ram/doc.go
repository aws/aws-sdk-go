// Package ram provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Resource Access Manager.
//
// This is the Resource Access Manager API Reference. This documentation provides
// descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM
// is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources
// to other Amazon Web Services accounts. If you use Organizations to manage
// your accounts, then you can share your resources with your entire organization
// or to organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you can also
// share resources with individual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles
// and users.
//

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Resource Access Manager with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
