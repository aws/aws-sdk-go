// Package managedblockchainquery provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Managed Blockchain Query.

// Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) Query provides you with convenient access
// to multi-blockchain network data, which makes it easier for you to extract
// contextual data related to blockchain activity. You can use AMB Query to
// read data from public blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin Mainnet and Ethereum
// Mainnet. You can also get information such as the current and historical
// balances of addresses, or you can get a list of blockchain transactions for
// a given time period. Additionally, you can get details of a given transaction,
// such as transaction events, which you can further analyze or use in business
// logic for your applications.
