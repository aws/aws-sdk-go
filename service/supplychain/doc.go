// Package supplychain provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Supply Chain.
//
// AWS Supply Chain is a cloud-based application that works with your enterprise
// resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management systems. Using AWS Supply
// Chain, you can connect and extract your inventory, supply, and demand related
// data from existing ERP or supply chain systems into a single data model.
//
// The AWS Supply Chain API supports configuration data import for Supply Planning.
//
// All AWS Supply chain API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed.
// They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive
// use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help facilitate
// access, trust, and permission policies.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/supplychain-2024-01-01 for more information on this service.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Supply Chain with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
