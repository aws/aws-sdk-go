// Package scheduler provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon EventBridge Scheduler.
//
// Amazon EventBridge Scheduler is a serverless scheduler that allows you to
// create, run, and manage tasks from one central, managed service. EventBridge
// Scheduler delivers your tasks reliably, with built-in mechanisms that adjust
// your schedules based on the availability of downstream targets. The following
// reference lists the available API actions, and data types for EventBridge
// Scheduler.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/scheduler-2021-06-30 for more information on this service.

// See scheduler package documentation for more information.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon EventBridge Scheduler with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
