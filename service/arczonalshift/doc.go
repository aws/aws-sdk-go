// Package arczonalshift provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS ARC - Zonal Shift.
//
// Welcome to the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application
// Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC).
//
// You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource
// away from an Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from
// an impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your
// application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web
// Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.
//
// You can also configure zonal autoshift for a load balancer resource. Zonal
// autoshift is a capability in Route 53 ARC where Amazon Web Services shifts
// away application resource traffic from an Availability Zone, on your behalf,
// to help reduce your time to recovery during events. Amazon Web Services shifts
// away traffic for resources that are enabled for zonal autoshift whenever
// Amazon Web Services determines that there's an issue in the Availability
// Zone that could potentially affect customers.
//
// To ensure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application, you must also
// configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a resource. Practice
// runs start weekly zonal shifts for a resource, to shift traffic for the resource
// out of an Availability Zone. Practice runs make sure, on a regular basis,
// that you have enough capacity in all the Availability Zones in an Amazon
// Web Services Region for your application to continue to operate normally
// when traffic for a resource is shifted away from one Availability Zone.
//
// You must prescale resource capacity in all Availability Zones in the Region
// where your application is deployed, before you configure practice runs or
// enable zonal autoshift for a resource. You should not rely on scaling on
// demand when an autoshift or practice run starts.
//

// Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html).

//
// To contact AWS ARC - Zonal Shift with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
