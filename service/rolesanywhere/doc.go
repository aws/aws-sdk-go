// Package rolesanywhere provides the client and types for making API
// requests to IAM Roles Anywhere.
//
// AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for
// your workloads such as servers, containers, and applications running outside
// of AWS to obtain Temporary AWS credentials. Your workloads can use the same
// IAM policies and roles that you have configured with native AWS applications
// to access AWS resources. Using IAM Roles Anywhere will eliminate the need
// to manage long term credentials for workloads running outside of AWS.
//
// To use IAM Roles Anywhere customer workloads will need to use X.509 certificates
// issued by their Certificate Authority (CA) . The Certificate Authority (CA)
// needs to be registered with IAM Roles Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish
// trust between customer PKI and IAM Roles Anywhere. Customers who do not manage
// their own PKI system can use AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate
// Authority (ACM PCA) to create a Certificate Authority and use that to establish
// trust with IAM Roles Anywhere
//
// This guide describes the IAM rolesanywhere operations that you can call programmatically.

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact IAM Roles Anywhere with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
