// Package rolesanywhere provides the client and types for making API
// requests to IAM Roles Anywhere.
//
// Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for your
// workloads such as servers, containers, and applications that run outside
// of Amazon Web Services to obtain temporary Amazon Web Services credentials.
// Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and roles you have for native
// Amazon Web Services applications to access Amazon Web Services resources.
// Using IAM Roles Anywhere eliminates the need to manage long-term credentials
// for workloads running outside of Amazon Web Services.
//
// To use IAM Roles Anywhere, your workloads must use X.509 certificates issued
// by their certificate authority (CA). You register the CA with IAM Roles Anywhere
// as a trust anchor to establish trust between your public key infrastructure
// (PKI) and IAM Roles Anywhere. If you don't manage your own PKI system, you
// can use Private Certificate Authority to create a CA and then use that to
// establish trust with IAM Roles Anywhere.
//
// This guide describes the IAM Roles Anywhere operations that you can call
// programmatically. For more information about IAM Roles Anywhere, see the
// IAM Roles Anywhere User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html).

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact IAM Roles Anywhere with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
