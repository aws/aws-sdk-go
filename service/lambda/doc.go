// Package lambda provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Lambda.
//
// Overview
//
// Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or
// managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure
// and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including
// server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic
// scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually
// any type of application or backend service. For more information about the
// Lambda service, see What is Lambda (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
// in the Lambda Developer Guide.
//
// The Lambda API Reference provides information about each of the API methods,
// including details about the parameters in each API request and response.
//
// You can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment
// (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For installation
// instructions, see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// For a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports, see Lambda
// endpoints and quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html/)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/lambda-2015-03-31 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Lambda with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

//
// See the AWS Lambda client Lambda for more
// information on creating client for this service.
