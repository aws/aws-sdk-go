// Package amplifyuibuilder provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Amplify UI Builder.
//
// The Amplify UI Builder API provides a programmatic interface for creating
// and configuring user interface (UI) component libraries and themes for use
// in your Amplify applications. You can then connect these UI components to
// an application's backend Amazon Web Services resources.
//
// You can also use the Amplify Studio visual designer to create UI components
// and model data for an app. For more information, see Introduction (https://docs.amplify.aws/console/adminui/intro)
// in the Amplify Docs.
//
// The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools, and
// documentation for client app development. For more information, see the Amplify
// Framework (https://docs.amplify.aws/). For more information about deploying
// an Amplify application to Amazon Web Services, see the Amplify User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Amplify UI Builder with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
