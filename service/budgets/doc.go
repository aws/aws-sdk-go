// Package budgets provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Budgets.
//
// Use the Amazon Web Services Budgets API to plan your service usage, service
// costs, and instance reservations. This API reference provides descriptions,
// syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for the
// Amazon Web Services Budgets feature.
//
// Budgets provide you with a way to see the following information:
//
//   - How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits
//
//   - Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your Reserved
//     Instances (RIs)
//
//   - Your current estimated charges from Amazon Web Services, and how much
//     your predicted usage will accrue in charges by the end of the month
//
//   - How much of your budget has been used
//
// Amazon Web Services updates your budget status several times a day. Budgets
// track your unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create
// the following types of budgets:
//
//   - Cost budgets - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.
//
//   - Usage budgets - Plan how much you want to use one or more services.
//
//   - RI utilization budgets - Define a utilization threshold, and receive
//     alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you see
//     if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.
//
//   - RI coverage budgets - Define a coverage threshold, and receive alerts
//     when the number of your instance hours that are covered by RIs fall below
//     that threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered
//     by a reservation.
//
