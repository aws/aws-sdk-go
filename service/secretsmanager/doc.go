// Package secretsmanager provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Secrets Manager.
//
// Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store,
// manage, and retrieve, secrets.
//
// This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information
// about using this service, see the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User
// Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html).
//
// API Version
//
// This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager
// API version 2017-10-17.
//
// As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
// SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
// languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android. The SDKs
// provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Amazon Web Services
// Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically signing
// requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more
// information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including downloading and
// installing them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// We recommend you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API
// calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP
// Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn
// more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see Making Query Requests
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide.
//
// Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and doesn't
// require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET
// requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations
// that require larger sizes, use a POST request.
//
// Support and Feedback for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
//
// We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com
// (mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com), or post your feedback and
// questions in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Discussion Forum (http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296).
// For more information about the Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums, see
// Forums Help (http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa).
//
// How examples are presented
//
// The JSON that Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager expects as your request
// parameters and the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests contain
// single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON
// shown in the examples displays the code formatted with both line breaks and
// white space to improve readability. When example input parameters can also
// cause long strings extending beyond the screen, you can insert line breaks
// to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON
// text string.
//
// Logging API Requests
//
// Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail,
// a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web
// Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using
// information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine
// the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request,
// when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
// and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see Logging Amazon Web Services
// Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail)
// in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. To learn more about
// CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the Amazon
// Web Services CloudTrail User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Secrets Manager with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
