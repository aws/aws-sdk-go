// Package synthetics provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Synthetics.
//
// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services.
// You can create and manage canaries, which are modular, lightweight scripts
// that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You can set up
// your canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you
// check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot
// anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and
// metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to
// help you trace the causes of impacted nodes in your applications. For more
// information, see Using ServiceLens to Monitor the Health of Your Applications
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html)
// in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
//
// Before you create and manage canaries, be aware of the security considerations.
// For more information, see Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html).

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Synthetics with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
