// Package apprunner provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS App Runner.
//
// App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective
// way to go directly from an existing container image or source code to a running
// service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn
// new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how
// to provision and configure Amazon Web Services resources.
//
// App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository.
// It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations,
// high performance, scalability, and security.
//
// For more information about App Runner, see the App Runner Developer Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/). For release information,
// see the App Runner Release Notes (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/).
//
// To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment
// (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API,
// see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// Endpoints
//
// For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see App
// Runner endpoints and quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS App Runner with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
