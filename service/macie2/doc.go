// Package macie2 provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Macie 2.
//
// Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that
// uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive
// data in AWS. Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data, such as PII
// and intellectual property, to provide you with insight into the data that
// your organization stores in AWS. Macie also provides an inventory of your
// Amazon S3 buckets, which it continually monitors for you. If Macie detects
// sensitive data or potential data access issues, it generates detailed findings
// for you to review and act upon as necessary.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/macie2-2020-01-01 for more information on this service.
