// Package computeoptimizer provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Compute Optimizer.
//
// Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization
// metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as Amazon EC2
// instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions, Amazon EBS volumes,
// and Amazon ECS services on Fargate. It reports whether your resources are
// optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and
// improve the performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides
// recent utilization metric data, in addition to projected utilization metric
// data for the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation
// provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your usage
// patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running resources,
// and still meet your performance and capacity requirements. For more information
// about Compute Optimizer, including the required permissions to use the service,
// see the Compute Optimizer User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/compute-optimizer-2019-11-01 for more information on this service.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Compute Optimizer with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
