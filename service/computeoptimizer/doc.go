// Package computeoptimizer provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Compute Optimizer.
//
// AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization
// metrics of your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances and Auto Scaling groups.
// It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization
// recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads.
// Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data, as well as
// projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you can
// use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance
// trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to
// move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and
// capacity requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer, including
// the required permissions to use the service, see the AWS Compute Optimizer
// User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/).

// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Compute Optimizer with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
