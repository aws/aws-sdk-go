// Package health provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Health APIs and Notifications.
//
// The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information
// that is presented in the AWS Personal Health Dashboard (https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/).
// You can get information about events that affect your AWS resources:
//
//    * DescribeEvents: Summary information about events.
//
//    * DescribeEventDetails: Detailed information about one or more events.
//
//    * DescribeAffectedEntities: Information about AWS resources that are affected
//    by one or more events.
//
// In addition, these operations provide information about event types and summary
// counts of events or affected entities:
//
//    * DescribeEventTypes: Information about the kinds of events that AWS Health
//    tracks.
//
//    * DescribeEventAggregates: A count of the number of events that meet specified
//    criteria.
//
//    * DescribeEntityAggregates: A count of the number of affected entities
//    that meet specified criteria.
//
// AWS Health integrates with AWS Organizations to provide a centralized view
// of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization.
//
//    * DescribeEventsForOrganization: Summary information about events across
//    the organization.
//
//    * DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization: List of accounts in your organization
//    impacted by an event.
//
//    * DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization: Detailed information about events
//    in your organization.
//
//    * DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization: Information about AWS resources
//    in your organization that are affected by events.
//
// You can use the following operations to enable or disable AWS Health from
// working with AWS Organizations.
//
//    * EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization: Enables AWS Health to work
//    with AWS Organizations.
//
//    * DisableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization: Disables AWS Health from
//    working with AWS Organizations.
//
//    * DescribeHealthServiceStatusForOrganization: Status information about
//    enabling or disabling AWS Health from working with AWS Organizations.
//
// The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from AWS Support
// (http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/). Calling the Health API from an account
// that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan causes a SubscriptionRequiredException.
//
// For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4 Signing
// Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
//
// See the AWS Health User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html)
// for information about how to use the API.
//
// Service Endpoint
//
// The HTTP endpoint for the AWS Health API is:
//
//    * https://health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Health APIs and Notifications with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
