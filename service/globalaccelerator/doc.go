// Package globalaccelerator provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Global Accelerator.
//
// This is the Global Accelerator API Reference. This guide is for developers
// who need detailed information about Global Accelerator API actions, data
// types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features,
// see the Global Accelerator Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html).
//
// Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve
// the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending
// on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits.
//
//   - By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your
//     internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard
//     accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over
//     the Amazon Web Services global network.
//
//   - For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator.
//     With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly
//     map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.
//
// Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple
// Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region
// to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example,
// specify --region us-west-2 on AWS CLI commands.
//
// By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that
// you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast
// from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global Accelerator provides
// two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global Accelerator provides a
// total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses and two static IPv6 addresses.
// With a standard accelerator for IPv4, instead of using the addresses that
// Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4
// addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring toGlobal Accelerator
// (BYOIP).
//
// For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic
// across multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions
// , which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard
// accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon
// EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one Amazon Web
// Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. For custom routing
// accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to
// specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC)
// subnets.
//
// The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as
// it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or
// routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static
// IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic
// by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global
// Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.
// For more information, see Tag-based policies (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html).
//
// For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services
// global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on
// health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts
// instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic
// from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints.
//

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Global Accelerator with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

//
// See the AWS Global Accelerator client GlobalAccelerator for more
// information on creating client for this service.
