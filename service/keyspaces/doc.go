// Package keyspaces provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Keyspaces.
//
// Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available,
// and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces
// makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads in the Amazon
// Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the Amazon Web Services Management
// Console or a few lines of code, you can create keyspaces and tables in Amazon
// Keyspaces, without deploying any infrastructure or installing software.
//
// In addition to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via open-source
// Cassandra drivers, Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition language (DDL)
// operations to manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web Services SDK
// and CLI, as well as infrastructure as code (IaC) services and tools such
// as CloudFormation and Terraform. This API reference describes the supported
// DDL operations in detail.
//
// For the list of all supported CQL APIs, see Supported Cassandra APIs, operations,
// and data types in Amazon Keyspaces (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/cassandra-apis.html)
// in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
//
// To learn how Amazon Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see
// Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#service-name-info-in-cloudtrail)
// in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
//
// For more information about Amazon Web Services APIs, for example how to implement
// retry logic or how to sign Amazon Web Services API requests, see Amazon Web
// Services APIs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html)
// in the General Reference.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Keyspaces with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// See the Amazon Keyspaces client Keyspaces for more
// information on creating client for this service.
