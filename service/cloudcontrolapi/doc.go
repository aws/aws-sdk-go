// Package cloudcontrolapi provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Cloud Control API.
//
// Use Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API to create, read, update, delete,
// and list (CRUD-L) your cloud resources that belong to a wide range of services--both
// Amazon Web Services and third-party. With the Cloud Control API standardized
// set of application programming interfaces (APIs), you can perform CRUD-L
// operations on any supported resources in your Amazon Web Services account.
// Using Cloud Control API, you won't have to generate code or scripts specific
// to each individual service responsible for those resources.
//
// For more information about Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API, see the
// Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudcontrolapi.html).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudcontrol-2021-09-30 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Cloud Control API with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
