// Package ssoadmin provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Single Sign-On Admin.
//
// Amazon Web Services Single Sign On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes
// it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple Amazon Web Services accounts
// and business applications. This guide provides information on SSO operations
// which could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts.
// For information about Amazon Web Services SSO features, see the Amazon Web
// Services Single Sign-On User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).
//
// Many operations in the SSO APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups,
// known as principals. For more information about how to work with principals
// and principal IDs in Amazon Web Services SSO, see the Amazon Web Services
// SSO Identity Store API Reference (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/sso-admin-2020-07-20 for more information on this service.

// See ssoadmin package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Single Sign-On Admin with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

//
// See the AWS Single Sign-On Admin client SSOAdmin for more
// information on creating client for this service.
