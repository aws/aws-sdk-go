// Package ssoadmin provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Single Sign-On Admin.
//
// AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) helps you securely
// create, or connect, your workforce identities and manage their access centrally
// across AWS accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the recommended
// approach for workforce authentication and authorization in AWS, for organizations
// of any size and type.
//
// Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and identitystore API namespaces
// will continue to retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes.
// For more information, see IAM Identity Center rename (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed).
//
// This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which
// could be used for access management of AWS accounts. For information about
// IAM Identity Center features, see the IAM Identity Center User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).
//
// Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users
// and groups, known as principals. For more information about how to work with
// principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the Identity Store
// API Reference (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html).
//
// AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
// languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs
// provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center
// and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including
// how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/sso-admin-2020-07-20 for more information on this service.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Single Sign-On Admin with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config
//
// See the AWS Single Sign-On Admin client SSOAdmin for more
// information on creating client for this service.
