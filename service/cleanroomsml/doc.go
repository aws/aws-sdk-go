// Welcome to the Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML API Reference.
//
// Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML provides a privacy-enhancing method for
// two parties to identify similar users in their data without the need to share
// their data with each other. The first party brings the training data to Clean
// Rooms so that they can create and configure an audience model (lookalike
// model) and associate it with a collaboration. The second party then brings
// their seed data to Clean Rooms and generates an audience (lookalike segment)
// that resembles the training data.
//
// To learn more about Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML concepts, procedures,
// and best practices, see the Clean Rooms User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/machine-learning.html).
