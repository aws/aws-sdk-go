// Package internetmonitor provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet
// issues impact the performance and availability between your applications
// hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users. It can reduce the time
// it takes for you to diagnose internet issues from days to minutes. Internet
// Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web Services captures from
// its global networking footprint to calculate a baseline of performance and
// availability for internet traffic. This is the same data that Amazon Web
// Services uses to monitor internet uptime and availability. With those measurements
// as a baseline, Internet Monitor raises awareness for you when there are significant
// problems for your end users in the different geographic locations where your
// application runs.
//
// Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch
// Metrics, to easily support using CloudWatch tools with health information
// for geographies and networks specific to your application. Internet Monitor
// sends health events to Amazon EventBridge so that you can set up notifications.
// If an issue is caused by the Amazon Web Services network, you also automatically
// receive an Amazon Web Services Health Dashboard notification with the steps
// that Amazon Web Services is taking to mitigate the problem.
//
// To use Internet Monitor, you create a monitor and associate your application's
// resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces directories
// - so Internet Monitor can determine where your application's internet traffic
// is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements from Amazon Web
// Services that are specific to the locations and ASNs (typically, internet
// service providers or ISPs) that communicate with your application.
