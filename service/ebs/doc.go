// Package ebs provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Elastic Block Store.
//
// You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create
// Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read data on
// your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between two snapshots.
// If youâ€™re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services
// for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and cost-effective
// to track incremental changes on your Amazon EBS volumes through snapshots.
// This can be done without having to create new volumes from snapshots, and
// then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to compare the
// differences.
//
// You can create incremental snapshots directly from data on-premises into
// volumes and the cloud to use for quick disaster recovery. With the ability
// to write and read snapshots, you can write your on-premises data to an snapshot
// during a disaster. Then after recovery, you can restore it back to Amazon
// Web Services or on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build
// and maintain complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.
//
// This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data
// types, parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information
// about the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how
// to use them effectively, see Accessing the Contents of an Amazon EBS Snapshot
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html)
// in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. For more information about
// the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas
// for the EBS direct APIs, see Amazon Elastic Block Store Endpoints and Quotas
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ebs-service.html) in the Amazon
// Web Services General Reference.

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Elastic Block Store with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
