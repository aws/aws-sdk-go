// Amazon Macie Classic is a security service that uses machine learning to
// automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS. Macie
// Classic recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable information
// (PII) or intellectual property, and provides you with dashboards and alerts
// that give visibility into how this data is being accessed or moved. For more
// information, see the Amazon Macie Classic User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/what-is-macie.html).
//
// A new Amazon Macie is now available with significant design improvements
// and additional features, at a lower price and in most AWS Regions. We encourage
// you to explore and use the new and improved features, and benefit from the
// reduced cost. To learn about features and pricing for the new Amazon Macie,
// see Amazon Macie (https://aws.amazon.com/macie/).
