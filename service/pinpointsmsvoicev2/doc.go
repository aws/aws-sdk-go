// # Regional availability

// several Amazon Web Services Regions and it provides an endpoint for each
// of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API
// is currently available, see Amazon Web Services Service Endpoints (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region)
// and Amazon Pinpoint endpoints and quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/pinpoint.html)

//
// In each Region, Amazon Web Services maintains multiple Availability Zones.
// These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are
// united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network
// connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels
// of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more
// about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region,
// see Amazon Web Services Global Infrastructure. (https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)
