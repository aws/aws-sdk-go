// Package applicationinsights provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server is a service
// that helps you detect common problems with your .NET and SQL Server-based
// applications. It enables you to pinpoint the source of issues in your applications
// (built with technologies such as Microsoft IIS, .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server),
// by providing key insights into detected problems.
//
// After you onboard your application, CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET
// and SQL Server identifies, recommends, and sets up metrics and logs. It continuously
// analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for unusual behavior to surface
// actionable problems with your application. For example, if your application
// is slow and unresponsive and leading to HTTP 500 errors in your Application
// Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights informs you that a memory pressure
// problem with your SQL Server database is occurring. It bases this analysis
// on impactful metrics and log errors.
