// Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps identify potential resource-access
// risks by enabling you to identify any policies that grant access to an external
// principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based
// policies in your Amazon Web Services environment. An external principal can
// be another Amazon Web Services account, a root user, an IAM user or role,
// a federated user, an Amazon Web Services service, or an anonymous user. You
// can also use IAM Access Analyzer to preview and validate public and cross-account
// access to your resources before deploying permissions changes. This guide
// describes the Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer operations that
// you can call programmatically. For general information about IAM Access Analyzer,
// see Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// To start using IAM Access Analyzer, you first need to create an analyzer.

// Using the Client
//
// To contact Access Analyzer with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
