// Package cloudwatchlogs provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
//
// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log
// files from EC2 instances, Amazon CloudTrail, or other sources. You can then
// retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the Amazon CloudWatch
// console, the CloudWatch Logs commands in the AWS CLI, the CloudWatch Logs
// API, or the CloudWatch Logs SDK.
//
// You can use CloudWatch Logs to:
//
//    * Monitor Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances in Real-time: You can use CloudWatch
//    Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example,
//    CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application
//    logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a
//    threshold you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring;
//    so, no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application
//    logs for specific literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException") or
//    count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position
//    in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When
//    the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data
//    to a Amazon CloudWatch metric that you specify.
//
//    * Monitor Amazon CloudTrail Logged Events: You can create alarms in Amazon
//    CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured
//    by CloudTrail and use the notification to perform troubleshooting.
//
//    * Archive Log Data: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data
//    in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so
//    that any log events older than this setting are automatically deleted.
//    The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both rotated and
//    non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then
//    access the raw log data when you need it.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/logs-2014-03-28 for more information on this service.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/cloudwatchlogs/
// for information on using this package.
//
// Using the Client
//
// To use the CloudWatchLogs client for Amazon CloudWatch Logs you will
// first need to create a new instance of it. Once the service's client is created
// you can begin to make API requests to the service using it. The client is safe
// to use across multiple goroutines concurrently.
//
// All clients require a Session. The Session provides the client with shared
// configuration such as region, endpoint, and credentials. A Session should be
// shared where possible to take advantage of configuration and credential caching.
// See the github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session package for more information.
//
//   sess := session.Must(session.NewSession())
//
// Create a new instance of the service's client with a Session. Optional
// aws.Config values can also be provided as variadic arguments to the
// New function. This option allows you to provide service specific configuration.
//
//   svc := cloudwatchlogs.New(sess)
//
// Once the client is created you can make an API request to the service.
// Each API method takes a input parameter, and returns the service response
// and an error.
//
// The API method will document which error codes the service can be returned
// by the operation if the service models the API operation's errors. These errors
// will also be available as const strings prefixed with "ErrCode".
//
//   result, err := svc.CancelExportTask(params)
//   if err != nil {
//       // Cast err to awserr.Error to handle specific error codes.
//       aerr, ok := err.(awserr.Error)
//       if ok && aerr.Code() == <error code to check for> {
//           // Specific error code handling
//       }
//       return err
//   }
//
//   fmt.Println("CancelExportTask result:")
//   fmt.Println(result)
//
// Using the Client with Context
//
// The service's client also provides methods to make API requests with a Context
// value. This allows you to control the timeout, and cancellation of pending
// requests. These methods also take request Option as variadic parameter to apply
// additional configuration to the API request. See the github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/request
// package for more information.
//
//   ctx := context.Background()
//
//   result, err := svc.CancelExportTaskWithContext(ctx, params)
