// Package networkmonitor provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor is an Amazon Web Services active network
// monitoring service that identifies if a network issues exists within the
// Amazon Web Services network or your own company network. Within Network Monitor
// you'll choose the source VPCs and subnets from the Amazon Web Services network
// in which you operate and then you'll choose the destination IP addresses
// from your on-premises network. From these sources and destinations, Network
// Monitor creates a monitor containing all the possible source and destination
// combinations, each of which is called a probe, within a single monitor. These
// probes then monitor network traffic to help you identify where network issues
// might be affecting your traffic.
