// Package networkmonitor provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor is an Amazon Web Services active network
// monitoring service that identifies if a network issues exists within the
// Amazon Web Services network or your own company network. Within Network Monitor
// you'll choose the source VPCs and subnets from the Amazon Web Services network
// in which you operate and then you'll choose the destination IP addresses
// from your on-premises network. From these sources and destinations, Network
// Monitor creates a monitor containing all the possible source and destination
// combinations, each of which is called a probe, within a single monitor. These
// probes then monitor network traffic to help you identify where network issues
// might be affecting your traffic.
//
// Before you begin, ensure the Amazon Web Services CLI is configured in the
// Amazon Web Services Account where you will create the Network Monitor resource.
// Network Monitor doesn’t support creation on cross-account resources, but
// you can create a Network Monitor in any subnet belonging to a VPC owned by
// your Account.
