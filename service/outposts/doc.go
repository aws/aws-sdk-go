// Package outposts provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Outposts.
//
// AWS Outposts is a fully-managed service that extends AWS infrastructure,
// APIs, and tools to customer premises. By providing local access to AWS-managed
// infrastructure, AWS Outposts enables customers to build and run applications
// on premises using the same programming interfaces as in AWS Regions, while
// using local compute and storage resources for lower latency and local data
// processing needs.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/outposts-2019-12-03 for more information on this service.
//
// See outposts package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Outposts with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
