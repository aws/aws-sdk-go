// Package appconfig provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon AppConfig.
//
// Use AWS AppConfig, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to create, manage,
// and quickly deploy application configurations. AppConfig supports controlled
// deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation
// checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on
// Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT
// devices.
//
// To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for
// production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage,
// AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic
// check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended.
// To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or
// a Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration
// deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid.
//
// During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to
// ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error,
// AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users.
// You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment
// that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms
// to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm,
// AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version.
//
// AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples.
//
//    * Application tuning: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to
//    your application that can only be tested with production traffic.
//
//    * Feature toggle: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a
//    timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement.
//
//    * User membership: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access
//    paid content.
//
//    * Operational issues: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application
//    when a dependency or other external factor impacts the system.

// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon AppConfig with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
