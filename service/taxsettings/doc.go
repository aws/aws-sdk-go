// Package taxsettings provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Tax Settings.
//
// You can use the tax setting API to programmatically set, modify, and delete
// the tax registration number (TRN), associated business legal name, and address
// (Collectively referred to as "TRN information"). You can also programmatically
// view TRN information and tax addresses ("Tax profiles").
//
// You can use this API to automate your TRN information settings instead of
// manually using the console.
