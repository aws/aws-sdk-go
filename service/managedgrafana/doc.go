// Package managedgrafana provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Managed Grafana.
//
// Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed and secure data visualization service
// that you can use to instantly query, correlate, and visualize operational
// metrics, logs, and traces from multiple sources. Amazon Managed Grafana makes
// it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Grafana, a widely deployed data visualization
// tool that is popular for its extensible data support.
//
// With Amazon Managed Grafana, you create logically isolated Grafana servers
// called workspaces. In a workspace, you can create Grafana dashboards and
// visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces without having to
// build, package, or deploy any hardware to run Grafana servers.
