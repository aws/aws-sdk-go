// Package entityresolution provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS EntityResolution.
//
// Welcome to the Entity Resolution API Reference.
//
// Entity Resolution is an Amazon Web Services service that provides pre-configured
// entity resolution capabilities that enable developers and analysts at advertising
// and marketing companies to build an accurate and complete view of their consumers.
//
// With Entity Resolution, you can match source records containing consumer
// identifiers, such as name, email address, and phone number. This is true
// even when these records have incomplete or conflicting identifiers. For example,
// Entity Resolution can effectively match a source record from a customer relationship
// management (CRM) system with a source record from a marketing system containing
// campaign information.
//
// To learn more about Entity Resolution concepts, procedures, and best practices,
// see the Entity Resolution User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/entityresolution/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html).
