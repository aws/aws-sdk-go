// Package deadline provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWSDeadlineCloud.
//
// The Amazon Web Services Deadline Cloud API provides infrastructure and centralized
// management for your projects. Use the Deadline Cloud API to onboard users,
// assign projects, and attach permissions specific to their job function.
//
// With Deadline Cloud, content production teams can deploy resources for their
// workforce securely in the cloud, reducing the costs of added physical infrastructure.
// Keep your content production operations secure, while allowing your contributors
// to access the tools they need, such as scalable high-speed storage, licenses,
// and cost management services.

// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
