// Package ssm provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM).
//
// Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that
// helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory,
// applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon
// Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications
// at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration
// of your managed nodes. A managed node is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
// (Amazon EC2) instance, edge device, or on-premises server or virtual machine
// (VM) that has been configured for Systems Manager.
//
// With support for IoT Greengrass core devices, the phrase managed instance
// has been changed to managed node in most of the Systems Manager documentation.
// The Systems Manager console, API calls, error messages, and SSM documents
// still use the term instance.
//
// This reference is intended to be used with the Amazon Web Services Systems
// Manager User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/).
//
// To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed nodes. For more
// information, see Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.

// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
