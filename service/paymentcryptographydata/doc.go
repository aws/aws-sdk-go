// Package paymentcryptographydata provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Payment Cryptography Data Plane.
//
// You use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane to manage
// how encryption keys are used for payment-related transaction processing and
// associated cryptographic operations. You can encrypt, decrypt, generate,
// verify, and translate payment-related cryptographic operations in Amazon
// Web Services Payment Cryptography. For more information, see Data operations
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/data-operations.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.
//
// To manage your encryption keys, you use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
// Control Plane (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
// You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also
// manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/payment-cryptography-data-2022-02-03 for more information on this service.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Payment Cryptography Data Plane with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
