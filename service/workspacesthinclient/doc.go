// Package workspacesthinclient provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client.
//
// Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client is a affordable device built to work with Amazon
// Web Services End User Computing (EUC) virtual desktops to provide users with
// a complete cloud desktop solution. WorkSpaces Thin Client is a compact device
// designed to connect up to two monitors and USB devices like a keyboard, mouse,
// headset, and webcam. To maximize endpoint security, WorkSpaces Thin Client
// devices do not allow local data storage or installation of unapproved applications.
// The WorkSpaces Thin Client device ships preloaded with device management
// software.
//
// You can use these APIs to complete WorkSpaces Thin Client tasks, such as
// creating environments or viewing devices. For more information about WorkSpaces
// Thin Client, including the required permissions to use the service, see the
// Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client Administrator Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces-thin-client/latest/ag/).
// For more information about using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage
// your WorkSpaces Thin Client resources, see the WorkSpaces Thin Client section
// of the CLI Reference (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/workspaces-thin-client/index.html).

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
