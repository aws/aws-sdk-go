// Package backupgateway provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Backup Gateway.
//
// Backup gateway connects Backup to your hypervisor, so you can create, store,
// and restore backups of your virtual machines (VMs) anywhere, whether on-premises
// or in the VMware Cloud (VMC) on Amazon Web Services.
//
// Add on-premises resources by connecting to a hypervisor through a gateway.
// Backup will automatically discover the resources in your hypervisor.
//
// Use Backup to assign virtual or on-premises resources to a backup plan, or
// run on-demand backups. Once you have backed up your resources, you can view
// them and restore them like any resource supported by Backup.
//
// To download the Amazon Web Services software to get started, navigate to
// the Backup console, choose Gateways, then choose Create gateway.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/backup-gateway-2021-01-01 for more information on this service.

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Backup Gateway with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
