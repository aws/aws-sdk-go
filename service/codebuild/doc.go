// Package codebuild provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS CodeBuild.
//
// CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles
// your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready
// to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale
// your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the
// most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven,
// Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild
// to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak
// build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more information
// about CodeBuild, see the CodeBuild User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codebuild-2016-10-06 for more information on this service.
//
// See codebuild package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS CodeBuild with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config
//
// See the AWS CodeBuild client CodeBuild for more
// information on creating client for this service.
