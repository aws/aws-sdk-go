// Package codebuild provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS CodeBuild.
//
// AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild
// compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are
// ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage,
// and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments
// for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apach
// Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments
// in AWS CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically
// to meet peak build requests, and you pay only for the build time you consume.
// For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the AWS CodeBuild User Guide.
//
// AWS CodeBuild supports these operations:
//
//    * BatchGetProjects: Gets information about one or more build projects.
//    A build project defines how AWS CodeBuild will run a build. This includes
//    information such as where to get the source code to build, the build environment
//    to use, the build commands to run, and where to store the build output.
//    A build environment represents a combination of operating system, programming
//    language runtime, and tools that AWS CodeBuild will use to run a build.
//    Also, you can add tags to build projects to help manage your resources
//    and costs.
//
//    * CreateProject: Creates a build project.
//
//    * DeleteProject: Deletes a build project.
//
//    * ListProjects: Gets a list of build project names, with each build project
//    name representing a single build project.
//
//    * UpdateProject: Changes the settings of an existing build project.
//
//    * BatchGetBuilds: Gets information about one or more builds.
//
//    * ListBuilds: Gets a list of build IDs, with each build ID representing
//    a single build.
//
//    * ListBuildsForProject: Gets a list of build IDs for the specified build
//    project, with each build ID representing a single build.
//
//    * StartBuild: Starts running a build.
//
//    * StopBuild: Attempts to stop running a build.
//
//    * ListCuratedEnvironmentImages: Gets information about Docker images that
//    are managed by AWS CodeBuild.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codebuild-2016-10-06 for more information on this service.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/codebuild/
// for information on using this package.
//
// Using the Client
//
// To use the CodeBuild client for AWS CodeBuild you will
// first need to create a new instance of it. Once the service's client is created
// you can begin to make API requests to the service using it. The client is safe
// to use across multiple goroutines concurrently.
//
// All clients require a Session. The Session provides the client with shared
// configuration such as region, endpoint, and credentials. A Session should be
// shared where possible to take advantage of configuration and credential caching.
// See the github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session package for more information.
//
//   sess := session.Must(session.NewSession())
//
// Create a new instance of the service's client with a Session. Optional
// aws.Config values can also be provided as variadic arguments to the
// New function. This option allows you to provide service specific configuration.
//
//   svc := codebuild.New(sess)
//
// Once the client is created you can make an API request to the service.
// Each API method takes a input parameter, and returns the service response
// and an error.
//
// The API method will document which error codes the service can be returned
// by the operation if the service models the API operation's errors. These errors
// will also be available as const strings prefixed with "ErrCode".
//
//   result, err := svc.BatchGetBuilds(params)
//   if err != nil {
//       // Cast err to awserr.Error to handle specific error codes.
//       aerr, ok := err.(awserr.Error)
//       if ok && aerr.Code() == <error code to check for> {
//           // Specific error code handling
//       }
//       return err
//   }
//
//   fmt.Println("BatchGetBuilds result:")
//   fmt.Println(result)
//
// Using the Client with Context
//
// The service's client also provides methods to make API requests with a Context
// value. This allows you to control the timeout, and cancellation of pending
// requests. These methods also take request Option as variadic parameter to apply
// additional configuration to the API request. See the github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/request
// package for more information.
//
//   ctx := context.Background()
//
//   result, err := svc.BatchGetBuildsWithContext(ctx, params)
