// Package codebuild provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS CodeBuild.
//
// AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild
// compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are
// ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage,
// and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments
// for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache
// Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments
// in AWS CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically
// to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume.
// For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the AWS CodeBuild User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codebuild-2016-10-06 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS CodeBuild with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// See the AWS CodeBuild client CodeBuild for more
// information on creating client for this service.
