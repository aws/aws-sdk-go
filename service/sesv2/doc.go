// Package sesv2 provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Simple Email Service.
//
// Welcome to the Amazon SES API v2 Reference. This guide provides information
// about the Amazon SES API v2, including supported operations, data types,
// parameters, and schemas.
//
// Amazon SES (https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint) is an AWS service that you can
// use to send email messages to your customers.
//
// If you're new to Amazon SES API v2, you might find it helpful to also review
// the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/).
// The Amazon SES Developer Guide provides information and code samples that
// demonstrate how to use Amazon SES API v2 features programmatically.
//
// The Amazon SES API v2 is available in several AWS Regions and it provides
// an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and
// endpoints where the API is currently available, see AWS Service Endpoints
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ses_region) in
// the Amazon Web Services General Reference. To learn more about AWS Regions,
// see Managing AWS Regions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
//
// In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability
// Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private,
// low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
// Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability
// and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number
// of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see AWS Global Infrastructure
// (http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/sesv2-2019-09-27 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Simple Email Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
