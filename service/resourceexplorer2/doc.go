// Package resourceexplorer2 provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Resource Explorer.
//
// Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and discovery
// service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your resources using
// an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of resources include
// Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances, Amazon Simple
// Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon DynamoDB tables. You can search
// for your resources using resource metadata like names, tags, and IDs. Resource
// Explorer can search across all of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your
// account in which you turn the service on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.
//
// Resource Explorer scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services
// Regions in your Amazon Web Services account in which you turn on Resource
// Explorer. Resource Explorer creates and maintains an index (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/arexug/mainline/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index)
// in each Region, with the details of that Region's resources.
//
// You can search across all of the indexed Regions in your account (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/arexug/mainline/manage-aggregator-region.html)
// by designating one of your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator
// index for the account. When you promote a local index in a Region to become
// the aggregator index for the account (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/arexug/mainline/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html),
// Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index information from all
// local indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator index. Therefore, the
// Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all resource information for
// all Regions in the account where you turned on Resource Explorer. As a result,
// views in the aggregator index Region include resources from all of the indexed
// Regions in your account.
//
// For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer, including
// how to enable and configure the service, see the Amazon Web Services Resource
// Explorer User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/).

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Resource Explorer with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
