// Package prometheusservice provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Prometheus Service.
//
// Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless, Prometheus-compatible
// monitoring service for container metrics that makes it easier to securely
// monitor container environments at scale. With Amazon Managed Service for
// Prometheus, you can use the same open-source Prometheus data model and query
// language that you use today to monitor the performance of your containerized
// workloads, and also enjoy improved scalability, availability, and security
// without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
//
// For more information about Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, see the
// Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/what-is-Amazon-Managed-Service-Prometheus.html)
// User Guide.
//
// Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus includes two APIs.
//
//   - Use the Amazon Web Services API described in this guide to manage Amazon
//     Managed Service for Prometheus resources, such as workspaces, rule groups,
//     and alert managers.
//
//   - Use the Prometheus-compatible API (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-APIReference.html#AMP-APIReference-Prometheus-Compatible-Apis)
//     to work within your Prometheus workspace.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/amp-2020-08-01 for more information on this service.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Prometheus Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
