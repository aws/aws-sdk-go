// Package simspaceweaver provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS SimSpace Weaver.
//
// SimSpace Weaver (SimSpace Weaver) is a managed service that you can use to
// build and operate large-scale spatial simulations in the Amazon Web Services
// Cloud. For example, you can create a digital twin of a city, crowd simulations
// with millions of people and objects, and massively multiplayer games with
// hundreds of thousands of connected players. For more information about SimSpace
// Weaver, see the SimSpace Weaver User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/) .
//
// This API reference describes the API operations and data types that you can
// use to communicate directly with SimSpace Weaver.
//
// SimSpace Weaver also provides the SimSpace Weaver app SDK, which you use
// for app development. The SimSpace Weaver app SDK API reference is included
// in the SimSpace Weaver app SDK documentation. This documentation is part
// of the SimSpace Weaver app SDK distributable package.
