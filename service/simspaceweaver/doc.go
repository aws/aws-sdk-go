// Package simspaceweaver provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS SimSpace Weaver.
//
// Amazon Web Services SimSpace Weaver (SimSpace Weaver) is a managed service
// that you can use to build and operate large-scale spatial simulations in
// the Amazon Web Services Cloud. For example, you can create a digital twin
// of a city, crowd simulations with millions of people and objects, and massilvely-multiplayer
// games with hundreds of thousands of connected players. For more information
// about SimSpace Weaver, see the Amazon Web Services SimSpace Weaver User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/) .
//
// This API reference describes the API operations and data types that you can
// use to communicate directly with SimSpace Weaver.
//
// SimSpace Weaver also provides the SimSpace Weaver app SDK, which you use
// for app development. The SimSpace Weaver app SDK API reference is included
// in the SimSpace Weaver app SDK documentation, which is part of the SimSpace
// Weaver app SDK distributable package.

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS SimSpace Weaver with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
