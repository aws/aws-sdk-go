// Package imagebuilder provides the client and types for making API
// requests to EC2 Image Builder.
//
// Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Image Builder provides a one-stop-shop to automate
// the image management processes. You configure an automated pipeline that
// creates images for use on AWS. As software updates become available, Image
// Builder automatically produces a new image based on a customizable schedule
// and distributes it to stipulated AWS Regions after running tests on it. With
// the Image Builder, organizations can capture their internal or industry-specific
// compliance policies as a vetted template that can be consistently applied
// to every new image. Built-in integration with AWS Organizations provides
// customers with a centralized way to enforce image distribution and access
// policies across their AWS accounts and Regions. Image Builder supports multiple
// image format AMIs on AWS.

// Using the Client
//
// To contact EC2 Image Builder with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.

// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
