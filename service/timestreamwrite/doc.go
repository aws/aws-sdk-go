// Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time-series database
// service that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of time-series
// data points per day. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze IoT
// sensor data to derive insights from your IoT applications. You can analyze
// industrial telemetry to streamline equipment management and maintenance.
// You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the performance
// and availability of your applications.

// Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively ingest, process, and
// store time-series data. It organizes data to optimize query processing. It
// automatically scales based on the volume of data ingested and on the query
// volume to ensure you receive optimal performance while inserting and querying
// data. As your data grows over time, Timestreamâ€™s adaptive query processing
// engine spans across storage tiers to provide fast analysis while reducing
// costs.
