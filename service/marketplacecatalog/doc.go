// Package marketplacecatalog provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Marketplace Catalog Service.
//
// Catalog API actions allow you to manage your entities through list, describe,
// and update capabilities. An entity can be a product or an offer on AWS Marketplace.
//
// You can automate your entity update process by integrating the AWS Marketplace
// Catalog API with your AWS Marketplace product build or deployment pipelines.
// You can also create your own applications on top of the Catalog API to manage
// your products on AWS Marketplace.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/marketplace-catalog-2018-09-17 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Marketplace Catalog Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
