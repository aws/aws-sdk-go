// Package workspaces provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon WorkSpaces.
//
// Amazon WorkSpaces enables you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft
// Windows or Amazon Linux desktops for your users, known as WorkSpaces. WorkSpaces
// eliminates the need to procure and deploy hardware or install complex software.
// You can quickly add or remove users as your needs change. Users can access
// their virtual desktops from multiple devices or web browsers.
//
// This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data
// types, parameters, and errors of the WorkSpaces service. For more information
// about the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas
// of the Amazon WorkSpaces service, see WorkSpaces endpoints and quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/wsp.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
//
// You can also manage your WorkSpaces resources using the WorkSpaces console,
// Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs. For more information about administering
// WorkSpaces, see the Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/).
// For more information about using the Amazon WorkSpaces client application
// or web browser to access provisioned WorkSpaces, see the Amazon WorkSpaces
// User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/). For
// more information about using the CLI to manage your WorkSpaces resources,
// see the WorkSpaces section of the CLI Reference (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/workspaces/index.html).

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon WorkSpaces with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
