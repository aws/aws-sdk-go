// Welcome to the AWS Clean Rooms API Reference.
//
// AWS Clean Rooms is an AWS service that helps multiple parties to join their
// data together in a secure collaboration workspace. In the collaboration,
// members who can query and receive results can get insights into the collective
// datasets without either party getting access to the other party's raw data.
//
// To learn more about AWS Clean Rooms concepts, procedures, and best practices,
// see the AWS Clean Rooms User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/what-is.html).

//
// To contact AWS Clean Rooms Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
