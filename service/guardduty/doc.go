// Package guardduty provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon GuardDuty.
//
// Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes
// and processes the following data sources: VPC flow logs, Amazon Web Services
// CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, EKS audit
// logs, DNS logs, and Amazon EBS volume data. It uses threat intelligence feeds,
// such as lists of malicious IPs and domains, and machine learning to identify
// unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your
// Amazon Web Services environment. This can include issues like escalations
// of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious
// IPs, domains, or presence of malware on your Amazon EC2 instances and container
// workloads. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances and
// container workloads serving malware, or mining bitcoin.
//
// GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for signs
// of compromise, such as unauthorized infrastructure deployments like EC2 instances
// deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls like
// a password policy change to reduce password strength.
//
// GuardDuty informs you about the status of your Amazon Web Services environment
// by producing security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console
// or through Amazon EventBridge. For more information, see the Amazon GuardDuty
// User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html) .

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon GuardDuty with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
