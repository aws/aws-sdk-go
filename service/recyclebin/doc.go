// Package recyclebin provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Recycle Bin.
//
// This is the Recycle Bin API Reference. This documentation provides descriptions
// and syntax for each of the actions and data types in Recycle Bin.
//
// Recycle Bin is a resource recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally
// deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. When using Recycle Bin, if your resources
// are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that
// you specify.
//
// You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention
// period expires. After you restore a resource from the Recycle Bin, the resource
// is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use it in the same way
// you use any other resource of that type in your account. If the retention
// period expires and the resource is not restored, the resource is permanently
// deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available for recovery. For
// more information about Recycle Bin, see Recycle Bin (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-recycle-bin.html)
// in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Recycle Bin with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
