  * Code that did type assertions from the operation's returned error to the value type would never be satisfied. Leading to errors being missed. Changing the function receiver to a pointer prevents this error. Highlighting it in code bases.

* `service/sts`: Updates service documentation
  * AWS Security Token Service (STS) now supports a regional configuration flag to make the client respect the region without the need for the endpoint parameter.

### SDK Enhancements
* `aws/endpoints`: Adds support for STS Regional Flags ([#2779](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/2779))
  * Implements STS regional flag, with support for `legacy` and `regional` options. Defaults to `legacy`. Legacy, will force all regions specified in aws/endpoints/sts_legacy_regions.go to resolve to the STS global endpoint, sts.amazonaws.com. This is the SDK's current behavior.
  * When the flag's value is `regional` the SDK will resolve the endpoint based on the endpoints.json model. This allows STS to update their service's modeled endpoints to be regionalized for all regions. When `regional` turned on use `aws-global` as the region to use the global endpoint.
  * `AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS=regional` for environment, or `sts_regional_endpoints=regional` in shared config file.
  * The regions the SDK defaults to the STS global endpoint in `legacy` mode are: 
    * ap-northeast-1
    * ap-south-1
    * ap-southeast-1
    * ap-southeast-2
    * aws-global

### Service Client Updates
* `service/mediapackage`: Updates service API and documentation
  * This release adds support for user-defined tagging of MediaPackage resources. Users may now call operations to list, add and remove tags from channels and origin-endpoints.

* `service/ssm`: Updates service API and documentation
  * This release updates AWS Systems Manager APIs to support service settings for AWS customers.

AWS customers can read a service setting via GetServiceSetting API and update the setting via UpdateServiceSetting API or ResetServiceSetting API, which are introduced in this release. For example, if an AWS service charges money to the account based on a feature or service usage, then the AWS service team might create a setting with the default value of "false".   This means the user can't use this feature unless they update the setting to "true" and  intentionally opt in for a paid feature.

### SDK Enhancements
* `aws/signer/v4`: Always sign a request with the current time. ([#2336](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/2336))
  * Updates the SDK's v4 request signer to always sign requests with the current time. For the first request attempt, the request's creation time was used in the request's signature. In edge cases this allowed the signature to expire before the request was sent if there was significant delay between creating the request and sending it, (e.g. rate limiting).
* `aws/endpoints`: Deprecate endpoint service ID generation. ([#2338](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/2338))

  * Adds support for the shared configuration file's `credential_process` property. This property allows the application to execute a command in order to retrieve AWS credentials for AWS service API request.  In order to use this feature your application must enable the SDK's support of the shared configuration file. See, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/#hdr-Sessions_from_Shared_Config for more information on enabling shared config support.

* Fix SDK's vet usage to use go vet with build tags ([#2300](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/2300))
  * Updates the SDK's usage of vet to use go vet instead of go tool vet. This allows the SDK to pass build tags and packages instead of just folder paths to the tool.

To index all detected faces regardless of quality, you can specify NONE.  This release also provides a MaxFaces parameter that is useful when you want to only index the most prominent and largest faces in an image and don't want to index other faces detected in the image, such as smaller faces belonging to people standing in the background.

  * Read Replicas for Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL now support Multi-AZ deployments.Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region. Updates made to the source database are asynchronously copied to the Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, you can choose to promote a Read Replica to become standalone a DB instance when needed.Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.You can now combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. Since Read Replicas can also be created in different regions than the source database, your Read Replica can be promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.For more information, see the Amazon RDS User Guide.

It takes as an input the fileShare ARN and refreshes the cache for only that file share. Additionally there is new functionality on file gateway that allows you configure what squash options they would like on their file share, this allows a customer to configure their gateway to not squash root permissions. This can be done by setting options in NfsOptions for CreateNfsFileShare and UpdateNfsFileShare APIs.

* `service/ec2`: Updates service API and documentation
	* Customers can now tag their Amazon EC2 Instances and Amazon EBS Volumes at
	the time of their creation. You can do this from the EC2 Instance launch
	wizard or through the RunInstances or CreateVolume APIs. By tagging
	resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run custom
	tagging scripts after resource creation. In addition, you can now set
	resource-level permissions on the CreateVolume, CreateTags, DeleteTags, and
	the RunInstances APIs. This allows you to implement stronger security
	policies by giving you more granular control over which users and groups
	have access to these APIs. You can also enforce the use of tagging and
	control what tag keys and values are set on your resources. When you combine
	tag usage and resource-level IAM policies together, you can ensure your
	instances and volumes are properly secured upon creation and achieve more
	accurate cost allocation reporting. These new features are provided at no
	additional cost.
