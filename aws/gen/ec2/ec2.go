// System reboot commonly occurs if certain maintenance or upgrade
// operations require a reboot of the underlying host that supports an
// instance. Instance reboot commonly occurs if the instance must be
// rebooted, rather than the underlying host. Rebooting events include a
// scheduled start and end time. System Maintenance: When Amazon EC2

// network impact, the instance status is the event code system-maintenance

// For power maintenance, your instance will be unavailable for a brief
// period of time and then rebooted. For network maintenance, your instance
// will experience a brief loss of network connectivity. System maintenance
// events include a scheduled start and end time. You will also be notified
// by email if one of your instances is set for system maintenance. The
// email message indicates when your instance is scheduled for maintenance.
// Scheduled Retirement: When Amazon EC2 determines that an instance must
// be shut down, the instance status is the event code instance-retirement
// . Retirement commonly occurs when the underlying host is degraded and
// must be replaced. Retirement events include a scheduled start and end
// time. You will also be notified by email if one of your instances is set
// to retiring. The email message indicates when your instance will be
// permanently retired. Scheduled Stop: When Amazon EC2 determines that an

// called instance-stop . Stop events include a scheduled start and end
// time. You will also be notified by email if one of your instances is set
// to stop. The email message indicates when your instance will be stopped.
// When your instance is retired, it will either be terminated (if its root
